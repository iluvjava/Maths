After the midterm, we will start to solve PDEs in multiple dimension. 

### **Week 6**

* Regular Cartesian Basis: 
	* [[Schordinger Eqn in Box]]
	* [[Helmholtz Equation In Rectangle]]
* Other kind of Basis: 
	* [[Helmholtz Equation in a Cylinder]]
	* [[Helmholtz Equation in a Sphere]]

And to do things in the other coordinate systems, we need tools like: 
* [[Bessel's Equation]]
* [[Frobenius Method]]

* Helmholtz equations in different coordinates are discussed in chapter 11 of the textbook. 

### **Week 7**

* Helmholtz Equation in the sphere: [[Helmholtz Equation in a Sphere]], and the basis function along the $\Theta$ direction give birth to the Associated Legendre Equation, and with a substitution, we get the [[Legendre Equation]]. 


### **Week 8**

* [[Sturm Liouville Theory]], The theorem that makes all the Eigen Functions for PDEs we learned before. 
* [[Eigenfunction Expansion]] method is introduced for Bounded None Homogeneous PDEs/ODEs

### **Week 9, 10**

* [[Greens Function]]
* [[Greens Function for Heat Eqn]]
* [[Greens Function 3, 3D Wave]]
* [[Greens Function 4, Nonhonogeneous Wave]]
