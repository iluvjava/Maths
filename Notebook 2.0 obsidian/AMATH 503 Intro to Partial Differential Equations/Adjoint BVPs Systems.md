### **Intro**

BVPs, boundary value problem, are essentially linear system in the functional spaces. We can generalizes linear system to BVPs in $C^p[a, b]\mapsto \mathbb R$, where, $p$ is determined by the highest order of the ODE. We want to identifies the adjoint operators of general forms for the system, and we want to characterizes the existence of the solutions for the linear system.
