This is going to be one of the important theorem when we are dealing with Fourier Series.

### **Theorem Statement**

Here is the theorem statement: 

**Dirichlet Theorem**: 

> If the function $F(x)$ is **bounded** and **piece-wise continuous** in the interval $[-L, L]$, then the Fourier Series of the function will equal to the function at the point where it's continuous, and it take the average of point where the function has a jump discontinuity. 
> 
> At the point of continuity, the series converges to the function uniformly (Citation needed). 

**Piece-wise Continuity**

> A function is piece-wise continuous if, there exists finitely many non-degenerate intervals where the function is continuous.
