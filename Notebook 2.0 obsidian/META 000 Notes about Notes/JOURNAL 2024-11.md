## **Research Proposal**

Imagined table of contents: 
1. Introduction and preliminaries. 
   1. Estimating sequence type of analysis. 
   2. Lyapunov type of analysis.
3. Forms and variants of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (Unpublished Paper). 
   1. PPM interpretation of Nesterov's acceleration. 
   2. Nesterov 2.2.19. 
   3. Method of Similar triangle.
	1. Convergence Analysis. 
4. PEP Performance Estimating problem (Literatures reviews). 
5. Catalyst acceleration and Accelerated proximal point (Contents of 590 report)
   1. Current state of research. 
   2. Potential applications and extension. 
6. Nestrerov's acceleration in the non-convex case (literature reviews). 
7. Method of Inexact Proximal point (literature reviews). 
8. Big Data analysis of Sentinel 2 VRI for species classifications via remote sensing. 
	1. Internship related works on wildfire control. 

Rank by priorities, we need to think through what to write for the sections that follows. 
Each section corresponds to a topic to cover in the thesis proposal. 

### **Nesterov's acceleration in the Non-convex case**

### **PEP performance analysis**
