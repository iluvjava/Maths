### **This month's topics**
A rework on the PPM interpretation of Nesterov Acceleration is now complete. 
For this month, on math research, we have the following list of things going on: 
1. Catalyst Acceleration Frameworks (Related to the Nesterov Acceleration)
2. Incremental methods and inexact proximal point method (Related to the proximal point method)

### **Thesis Proposal**
We don't think it's wise to procrastinate this matter, hence we are going to brain storm the situation seriously here. 

#### Theme 
1. Algorithm convergence analysis
2. Applying Catalyst Frameworks to a larger context, where applications and programming is relevant. 


### **Misc random stuff**

- [Linear Convergence From PL Condition](../Linear%20Convergence%20From%20PL%20Condition.md), Polyak Lojawiesz and smoothness gives linear convergence of gradient descent and proximal point method.
