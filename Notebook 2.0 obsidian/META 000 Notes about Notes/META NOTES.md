# **Important Tasks about the Notes**

- [ ] Complete and link: [INVESTIGATIONS JUL 23 2023](MATH%20---%20Unexplored/NOTES/INVESTIGATIONS%20JUL%2023%202023.md), to the alternative proof of convex measurability.

# **Tasks to Do about the Notes**

Something to do when we have time. 

### **Statistical Inferences**
- [ ] Add stuff for statistics inference related materials. 
	- [ ] [Asymptotic Behaviors of MLEs](STATS%20501%20Statistics%20for%20Mathematicians/Asymptotic%20Behaviors%20of%20MLEs.md). Characterize. 
	- [ ] Discuss the MLE, hypothesis testing for the exponential family. 
		- [x] [The Exponential Family](STATS%20501%20Statistics%20for%20Mathematicians/The%20Exponential%20Family.md), 
		- [x] [MLE, Sufficient Statistics of the Exponential Family](STATS%20501%20Statistics%20for%20Mathematicians/MLE,%20Sufficient%20Statistics%20of%20the%20Exponential%20Family.md), 
		- [x] [Examples of Exponential Family](STATS%20501%20Statistics%20for%20Mathematicians/Examples%20of%20Exponential%20Family.md) 
	- [ ] Add an entry about the Wald test method and likelihood ratio, continuing that discussion from [Hypothesis Testing](STATS%20501%20Statistics%20for%20Mathematicians/Hypothesis%20Testing.md). 
- [ ] Make An Indexer Page for Optimizations

### **Optimizations**
- [ ] Add/link some calculus rules for the projection, distance operator described here: [[AMATH 516 Numerical Optimizations/Background/Convex Sets Projections and Dist, Intro]], add them from Heinz's course notes yes. 
- Fill up [Functional Analysis CENTRAL HUB](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis,%20Measure%20Theory/Functional%20Analysis%20CENTRAL%20HUB.md), by considering: 
	- [ ] [Linear Mapping in Banach Space](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis,%20Measure%20Theory/Linear%20Mapping%20in%20Banach%20Space.md), Add information about the adjoin operator in Banach space, mostly its definition
	- [ ] [Uniform Boundedness, Open Mapping](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis,%20Measure%20Theory/Uniform%20Boundedness,%20Open%20Mapping.md). Finish the proof for this one, as an application of the Baire's category theorem to Banach spaces. 

### PDE
- Fill up a sequence of notes that describes the idea of adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces, and their applications. Files included are: 
	- [x] [Sturm Liouville Theory](AMATH%20503%20Intro%20to%20Partial%20Differential%20Equations/Sturm%20Liouville%20Theory.md)
		- Cite the theories for the S.L Adjoin BVP theories from Sturm Liouville. 
		- Improve cringe examples for the Sturm Liouville systems example. 
		- Improve the parts of the orthogonality proofs for the Eigen system using the notes on your ipad and from professor Erics 319. 
	- [x] And a note about how to use *Fredholm alternative* applied to the PDE BVP system.

# **Tasks that Probably Will Never Get Done**

- Add theorem 4.17 in the course notes for math 328, regarding the existence of an orthogonal basis for every Hilbert space, as a consequence of the Zorn's Lemma.

# **Tasks Done for Keeping Track of Things**

# **TAG Systems**

- #UNFINISHED is a tag that describes unfinished works. 
- #CITATION_NEEDED need to add citations for some claims 
- #HEINZ Professor Heinz's Special Deliveries. 
- #INCORRECT  CORECT The claim is just wrong, and I don't know what is right, so I just tag it. 
- #LATER Unfinished and I don't want to work on it anytime soon. 
- #UNSOLVED Some issues, or questions that is unresolved. 
- #CRINGE, Very cringe writing please improve.
