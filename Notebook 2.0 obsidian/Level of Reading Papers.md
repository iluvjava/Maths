Since a piece of research paper is very complicated, I made up these levels of readings to classify different meanings when I said "I read that paper". 

- **I looked at it**: 
	- It means I read the abstract, looked into the author, scanned some keywords. 
- **I read it for a bit**: 
	- The first level is already satisfied, in addition, I googled into the background and intro, dig into relevant concepts,  so I am more aware of the contribution they claim, and I also understand better their conclusions and experiments. 
- **I read it**: 
	- In addition of the last level, I go over some of the proofs for the claims, and is somewhat aware of the major references materials involved for their central arguments where contributions were made. 
- **I read it carefully**: 
	- In addition to all above, I filled up some gaps of their proofs and potentials errors/typo will be spotted at this stage. How clear their proofs are and how much steps they skip will also be clear to me. The tools of analysis they used and concepts involved will be understood by me at this stage. Whether the claims has redundant conditions, where each conditions, properties are used should also be clear to me after this stage of readings. 
- **I read it carefully and thoroughly**: 
	- The above stage is complete and done for everything in the paper.
