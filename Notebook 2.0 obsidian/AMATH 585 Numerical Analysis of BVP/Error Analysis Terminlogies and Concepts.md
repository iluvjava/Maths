### **Intro**

We classify the errors. When it comes to error analysis we are interested in 2 types of error: 
- A priori Errors. 
- Posterior Errors. 

To illustrate, suppose that we were given solution $u$, which is the solution to a PDE for example, we then denote $\tilde u_h$ to be the approximated solution of $u$ by some kind of numerical method, parameterized by $h$, for example, the size of the mesh grid.
