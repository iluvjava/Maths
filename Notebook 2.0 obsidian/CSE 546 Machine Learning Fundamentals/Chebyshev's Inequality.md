### **Intro**

$X$ is a random variable with finite mean and variance $\mu,\sigma$, then for any real number $k>0$, we have: 
$$
\mathbb{P}\left(
        |X - \mu| \ge k\sigma 
    \right)\le 
    \frac{1}{k^2}
$$

**Observations**
Take note that: the mean and variance is from the theoretical distribution of the distribution of the random variable, which is not the sample mean and variances, which are empirically estimated.
