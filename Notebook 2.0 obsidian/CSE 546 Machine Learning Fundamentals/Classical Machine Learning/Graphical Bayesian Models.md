### **Intro**

We only requires knowledge about the basic conditional probability to gain understanding of graphical models, including but not limited, Bayesian Network type of models.

This file will be based on chapter 2 of the second volume of machine learning Bible: Machine Learning, A Probabilistic Perspective by Kelvin Murphy.

### **DAG And Conditional Probability**

Conditional probability can be represented as graphs. 
(Directed Acyclic Graph) DAGs is a special type of directed graphs where there are no cycles inside of the graph. 
The graph consist of vertices. 
They are the random variables. 
We model the existence of a probability dependence by arcs in the graph. 
Arcs on the graph is also associated with the conditional probabilities. 
The absent of arcs represent probability independent between the random variables. 
We formalize the definitions next.
