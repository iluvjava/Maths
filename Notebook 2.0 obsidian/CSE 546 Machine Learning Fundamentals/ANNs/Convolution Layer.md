### **Intro**

Convolutional layer is made to approximate convolution operation in mathematics. 
Vectors in neural networks can be treated a discrete representation of a one dimensional functions on a bounded domain. 
If reader knows, recall [Introduction to Wavelets](../../AMATH%20582%20Data%20Science/Introduction%20to%20Wavelets.md) but the kernel function is now a learnable parameters for the artificial neural network. 
This component in modern artificial neural network has a history.
