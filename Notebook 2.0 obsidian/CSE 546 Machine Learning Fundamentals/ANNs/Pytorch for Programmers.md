### **Intro**

If you don't want math and shit and just want to write stupid computer code and deal with the stupid computer then in this file we go over the Pytorch APIs for deep learning. 
We will also talk about the Torch Vision APIs as well. 

#### Differentiable Module
> See [Module â€” PyTorch 2.2 documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html) for more information.
