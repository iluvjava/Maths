### **Linear Map**

A liner mapping is a mapping craeted between 2 Euclidean spaces, say $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}$, to this regard, let's say we have a linear operator $A$ defined as a mapping from $\mathbf{X}$ to $\mathbf{Y}$. 

**Adjoint:**

For any given linear mapping, mapping between 2 Euclidean spaces (could be the same, or different), there exists an adjoint operator, denoted as $A^*$ such that: 

> $$
> \left\langle Ax, y \right\rangle = \left\langle x, A^*y \right\rangle \quad 
> \forall \; x\in \mathbf{X}, y\in \mathbf{Y}
> $$
And, $A^*$ maps from $\mathbf{Y}$ to $\mathbf{X}$. 

**Linear Operator:** 

A linear operator maps from the same Euclidean space back to itself, if we are talking about $\mathbb{R}^n$ then it would be a square matrix over $\mathbb{R}^n$.

**Self-Adjoing Linear Opertor**

Symmetric or Hermitian matrices, $A^H = A$. 

And then, we are back to the normal definition of P.S.D, and P.D matrices. [[Hermitian Adjoint]].
