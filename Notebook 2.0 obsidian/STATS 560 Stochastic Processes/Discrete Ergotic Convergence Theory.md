### **Intro**

The following theorem characterizes one of the cases when the Markov chain converges to a stationary distribution. 

**Theorem: 1.19(Rick's Essential)**

> Suppose that $p$ is irreducible, aperiodic, and has a stationary distribution $\pi$. Then as $a\rightarrow \infty$, $p^n(x, y)\rightarrow \pi(y)$.
