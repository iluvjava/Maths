### **Intro**

Terence Tao is one of the examples of a smart kid who were put into the educations path for mathematics and become successful. In this file we assume that education plays a proper role for incubating gifted kids, and focus instead on why some kids appears to be smart but it might not correspond to giftedness in advanced mathematics. We refers the wold "*giftedness*" as a type of promise that the kid, or student can be educated in mathematics properly and become successful. 

I think the reasons behind the fact that many kids were falsely identified to be good at mathematics are that the general populations, or the educators don't understand the type of qualities one would actually need for advanced mathematics. Here I will start of immediately by listing some commons observations that definitely doesn't correspond to giftedness in advanced mathematics: 
1. Good at numbering. 
2. Good at memorizations. 
3. Good at imitating. 
4. Thinks, react very fast^[Thinking too slow is also not a good sign to for mathematical promise.]. 

The first two items are obvious. The third item is not a sign of giftedness because imitations might not require understanding of the topic itself. The last one is important but with a catch. Thinking very fast is certainly advantageous, but it alone will impede mathematical thinking sometimes. The fast-thinking students have the potential downfall of skipping important steps and follow by intuitions, which is dangerous because advanced mathematics is all about discovering complicated, unintuitive truths. 

I think these are the qualities that make a kid promising for mathematics: 
1. Near infinite patience for the subject. 
2. Never fear math and insist on trying every possible ways to verify an idea, improve a concept, or looking for a connection. 
3. Thrive in a systematic way of learning. 
4. Has a divergent way of thinking and stress more on the patterns, relations, symmetry or some other abstract ideas behind a problem, or a concept. 

Infinite patience is required and it's a must. Unless the kid is a "super intelligence", it's very likely it will make mistakes and relearn things again and again. Fear will hinder the mathematical performance dramatically because they are not giving enough trials to learn and practice, and looking for alternative methods allows them to spot connections between ideas and form abstractions between concepts. Thrive in a systematic way of learning is required because that is how advanced mathematics are taught in educational institutions. Divergent thinking is needed and the prompt is self-explanatory.
