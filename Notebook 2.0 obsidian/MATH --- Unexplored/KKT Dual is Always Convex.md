[[Introducing The KKT Conditions]]

### **Intro**

Example 3.7 in \<First Order Method in Optimizations\> by SIAM stated trivially that the dual problem from KKT is always a convex function. We state the example here for convenience. 

Consider minimization problem: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \min_{x\in \mathcal X}\{f(x): h(x) \le 0\}
    \\
    &\mathcal X \neq \emptyset, \mathcal X \subseteq \mathbb E
\end{aligned}
$$

with $f: \mathbb E \mapsto \mathbb R$ and $h(x): \mathbb E \mapsto \mathbb R^m$. Then define the Lagrangian Dual Objective as:
