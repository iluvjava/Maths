We show that FISTA is an automatic geometrically optimized algorithm for functions satisfying a quadratic growth assumption. This explains why FISTA works better than the standard Forward-Backward algorithm (FB) in such a case, although FISTA is known to have a polynomial asymptotic convergence rate while FB is exponential. We provide a simple rule to tune the¬†ùõº¬†parameter within the FISTA algorithm to reach an¬†ŒµŒµ-solution with an optimal number of iterations. These new results highlight the efficiency of FISTA algorithms, and they rely on new non asymptotic bounds for FISTA.","x":-780,"y":660,"width":1094,"height":316},
