### **Investigation Statement**

Pull out all the threads relevant to the theorem 5.13 in Heinz Monotone Operator Books. 

It's proving the convergence of fixed point iterations in Hilbert Spaces, but we need to be careful about how it address the issue of weak convergence and weak sequential compactness of convex sets in the Hilbert space.
