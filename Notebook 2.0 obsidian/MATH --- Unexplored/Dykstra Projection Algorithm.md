A Cyclic Projection Algorithm Via duality:
[here](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02614077.pdf), Old paper need institution account to access resource.

Dykstra’s Algorithm, ADMM, and Coordinate Descent: Connections, Insights, and Extensions: 
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04768.pdf), new paper, free access. <-- Really should look into this one. It's also locally added to the notebook [Dykstra’s Algorithm, ADMM, and Coordinate Descent-Connections, Insights, and Extensions](../MATH%20999%20Paper%20Reviews%20and%20Frontier%20Mathematics/References%20Sep%202022/Dykstra%E2%80%99s%20Algorithm,%20ADMM,%20and%20Coordinate%20Descent-Connections,%20Insights,%20and%20Extensions.pdf)
