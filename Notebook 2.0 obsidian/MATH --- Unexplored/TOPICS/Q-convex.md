### **Intro**

In paper "Linear convergence of first order methods for non-strongly convex optimization" by Necoara, Nesterov, F. Glineur proposed the condition of Quasi strong convexity (Q-S-CNVX) for considering the linear convergence of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method and projected gradient for objective function that may not be strongly convex.
