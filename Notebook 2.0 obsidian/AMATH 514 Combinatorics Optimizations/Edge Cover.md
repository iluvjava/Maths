### **Intro**

> An edge cover of a graph is a subset of edges from the graph such that all vertices in the graph are touching at least some of the edges in the set. 


Let $G:=(V, E)$ and $F\subset E$ be edge cover then: 

$$
v \in V \implies v \in \bigcup_{e\in E} e
$$

Any super set of an edge cover is an edge cover, therefore we are interested in an minimum edge cover, denoted as: $\rho(G)$, which is the cardinality of the minimum edge cover set.
