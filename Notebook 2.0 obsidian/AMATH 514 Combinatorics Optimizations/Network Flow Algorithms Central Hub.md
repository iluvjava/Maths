### **Intro**

**Shortest Path types of Algorithm**: 

- (Dijkstra Algorithm)[[../AMATH 514 Combinatorics Optimizations/Everything Network Flow/Dijkstra Algorithm]] 
	- No negative cycles.
	- No negative arcs.
	- Single source. 
- (Moore Bellman Ford Algorithm)[[../AMATH 514 Combinatorics Optimizations/Everything Network Flow/FIFO Label Correcting Algorithm]] 
	- Negative Cycle Detections.
	- Single Source.
- (Floyd Warshall Shortest Path)[[../AMATH 514 Combinatorics Optimizations/Everything Network Flow/All Pairs Shortest Paths]] 
	- Negative cycles detections. 
	- Construct all pairs shortest distances and predecessor tree all at once.
