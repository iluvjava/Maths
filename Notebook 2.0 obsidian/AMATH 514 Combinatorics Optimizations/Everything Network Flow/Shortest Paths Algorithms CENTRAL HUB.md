### **Intro**

We make one file that list some of the important discussion about shortest path, as a network flow problem. This file is made with the intention for reviewing for the final of the network flow class. 

**Theoretical Foundations**: 

- [LP for Source Tree Shortest Paths](LP%20for%20Source%20Tree%20Shortest%20Paths.md). 
	- The LP formulations of the single source shortest path problem, 
	- Assumptions for the shortest path problem. 
	- the relaxation conditions from the dual, 
	- and the optimal path conditions from the dual. 

We list the algorithms and give them their own summary.
