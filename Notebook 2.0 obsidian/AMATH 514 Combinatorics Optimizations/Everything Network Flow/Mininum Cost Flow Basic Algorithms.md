[[Network Flow Standard Form]]

---
### **Intro**

Specialized algorithms for minimum cost flow type of problems are very fast, compare to the alternative such as the interior points method, or the simplex that solves the LP representation of the problem instead of the network flow problem directly. 

**Assumptions**

1. All data on the graphs are integers. 
2. The network is directed. There is only one arc between each node. 
3. The sum of all the supplies and demands will sum up to zero. 
4. All costs are non-negative in the network.
