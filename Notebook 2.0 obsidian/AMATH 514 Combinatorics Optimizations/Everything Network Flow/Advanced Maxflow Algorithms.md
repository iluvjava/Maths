[[Maxflow Min Cut, Ford Fulkerson]]

---
### **Intro**

We introduce some advanced algorithms for solving maxflow min cut. These algorithms are strongly polynomials. 

The simplest way to improve Ford Fulkerson is the Edmonds Karp algorithm. It uses a BFS routine to compute the shortest augmenting path from $s$ to $t$, and then augment the path. It does this each time for looking for augmenting path.
