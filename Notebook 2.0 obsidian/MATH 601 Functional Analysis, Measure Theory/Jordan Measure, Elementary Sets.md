### **Intro**

Measure theory is now introduced into $\mathbb R^n$. The questions of measure theory are motivated by some of the difficulties of assigning values for sets in multiple dimension. The Jordan measure was a naive attempts, and it's best to study for context of modern measure theory. For this file, we will follow Terence Tao's Introduction to Measure Theory textbook.
