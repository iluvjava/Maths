### **Intro**

We follow the course notes for the MIT OCW class, Shambavi's notes, and Kryzig's Functional analysis textbook. 


#### **Thm | Uniform Boundedness Theorem**
> Let $T_n: X \mapsto Y$ be a sequencer of bounded linear operator. 
> Let $X$ be a Banach space and $Y$ be a normed space. 
> Let $\Vert T_nx\Vert < \infty$ for all $x \in X$. 
> Let's say that $\Vert T_nx\Vert \le c_x$ for $n = 1, \cdots$. 
> Then with the the sequence of norm $\Vert T_n \Vert$ is bounded, i.e: there exists $c$ such that $\Vert T_n\Vert \le c$ for all $n \in \mathbb N$. 

**Observations**

Recall that, in real analysis, the sequence of a bounded function, it may not has a limit that is a bounded functions. 
We emphasize that $Y$ is a normed space in the sense that it may not be completed. 
But it can be completed. 


**Proof**



**Remarks**

This theorem is important for the boundedness of a weakly converging sequence.
