### **Intro**

Hilbert space has favorable properties for sets that are compact. 
We will state and proof the sufficient conditions for bounded and closed set in Hilbert space to be compact. 
We will take reference from [MIT lecture notes](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-102-introduction-to-functional-analysis-spring-2009/00667882fb5855c8013c8cfe8fe6c49e_MIT18_102s09_lec12.pdf) for functional analysis.
