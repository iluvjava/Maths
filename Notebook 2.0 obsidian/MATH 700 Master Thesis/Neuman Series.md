### **Intro**

Neuman Series is: 

$$
(\text{Id} - T)^{-1} = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}T^k
$$

If we assume that the series converges. In the case of linear operator, we can derive the series from the formula proved in the prerequisite of this page. 

> $$
> (I + P)^{-1} = I- Pï¼ˆI+ P)^{-1} = I - (I + P)^{-1}P \tag{1}
> $$

Unroll the recurrence and we get the Neuman Series.
