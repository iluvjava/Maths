### **Intro**

Multi Resolution analysis is a nice computational method that can take the frequencies information from different parts of the signal that highlight both the frequencies and locality. 
It's different from a generic continuous wavelet transform, multi-resolution analysis is a computational approach that is efficient, and fundamentally discrete.
