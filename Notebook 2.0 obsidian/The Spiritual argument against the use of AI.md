# **Intro**
TLDR: 
> We argue against the indulgence into artificial intelligences (Specifically large generative machine learning models) for creativity processes, because: 
> 1. It fuels demands for large capitalistic institutions instead of genuine human interaction. 
> 2. It devalues the spirituality of living as a homo sapient on earth. 
> 3. Over indulgence in AI may not assist, or, improve your skills in creativity tasks in the long term.
