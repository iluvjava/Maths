#### **The PPM Interpretation saga**

1. [Nesterov Type Acceleration via Proximal Point Method Part I](Nesterov%20Type%20Acceleration%20via%20Proximal%20Point%20Method%20Part%20I.md)
2. [Nesterov Type Acceleration via Proximal Point Method Part II](Nesterov%20Type%20Acceleration%20via%20Proximal%20Point%20Method%20Part%20II.md)
3. [Nesterov Type Acceleration via Proximal Point Method Part III](Nesterov%20Type%20Acceleration%20via%20Proximal%20Point%20Method%20Part%20III.md)

The old saga doesn't work out well due to the dependence on a Lyapunov analysis that assumed too much on the parameters that controls the convergence rate.
