### **Techniques of Estimating Sequences**

These ideas of Nesterov's accelerated method were grounded in Euclidean space and Nesterov's estimating sequence.

### **PPM interpretations and Form Analysis**

This interpretations of Nesterov's acceleration originated from Ahn and Sra's paper are pure trash. 

1. [PPM Interpretation of APG Algorithm Preludes](PPM%20Interpretation%20of%20APG%20Algorithm%20Preludes.md)
2. [PPM APG Forms](PPM%20APG%20Forms.md)
3. [PPM APG Forms Analysis](PPM%20APG%20Forms%20Analysis.md)
4. [PPM APG, Convergence Part I](PPM%20APG,%20Convergence%20Part%20I.md)

#### **The PPM Interpretation saga**

1. [Nesterov Type Acceleration via Proximal Point Method Part I](Nesterov%20Type%20Acceleration%20via%20Proximal%20Point%20Method%20Part%20I.md)
2. [Nesterov Type Acceleration via Proximal Point Method Part II](Nesterov%20Type%20Acceleration%20via%20Proximal%20Point%20Method%20Part%20II.md)
3. [Nesterov Type Acceleration via Proximal Point Method Part III](Nesterov%20Type%20Acceleration%20via%20Proximal%20Point%20Method%20Part%20III.md)

The old saga doesn't work out well due to the dependence on a Lyapunov analysis that assumed too much on the parameters that controls the convergence rate.
