### **Intro**

The major theme in this file is to: 
1. Review the connections between Lyapunov analysis and the Amir Beck's style proof of the V-FISTA algorithm. 
2. Go through the proof in a simplified manner. 
3. Perform a form match directly between the V-FISTA algorithm and the Nesterov's estimated sequence APG method, which are both equivalent to the similar triangle algorithm.
