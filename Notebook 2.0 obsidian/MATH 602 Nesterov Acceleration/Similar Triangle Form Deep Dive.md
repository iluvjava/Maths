### **Intro**

We declare a non-dimensionalized description of Nesterov's accelerated gradient, and analyze the relations between its iterates. 
We first do that without using the relaxed momentum sequence, we next do that with the
knowledge of the sequence. 

Follows from the previous writing, we declare the similar triangle form for Nesterov's accelerated Gradient method to be:
