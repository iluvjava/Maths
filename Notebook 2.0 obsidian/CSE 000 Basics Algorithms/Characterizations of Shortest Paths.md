### **Intro**

We assume that: 
1. The cost of the functions can all be integers. 
2. The graph is directed.
3. The graph is connected.
4. There is no directed cycle with a costs that is negative. 

Then, we will be able to find the shorts path between 2 vertices with algorithms that are not too complicated.
