- There should be another file taking about the convergence of random variables?

### **Intro**

The central limit theorem is about the convergence of sample means. We state the theorem without proof for future references. It's too famous to be skipped. 

#### **Thm | Central Limit Theorem**
> Let $Y_1, \cdots, Y_n$ be i.i.d random variables drawn from a distribution with $\mathbb{E}\left[Y\right] = \mu < \infty$ and $\mathbb{E}\left[ Y\right] < \sigma^2$, then, let sample mean $\bar Y = (1/n)\sum_{i = 1}^{n}Y_i$, we have $\sqrt{n}(\bar Y - \mu) \rightarrow_{d} \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$, the deviation of the sample mean scaled by $\sqrt{n}$ converges to a singleton. 


**Proof**

We skip the proof for now.
