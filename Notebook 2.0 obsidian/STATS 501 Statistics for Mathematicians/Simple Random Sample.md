### **Intro**

A simple random sample technique is sampling from a population with fixed, finite amount of elements without a replacement. They may have all unique values, or may have overlapping values and be grouped by their values. Let $N$ be the total number of elements from the populations. The process choose a subset of $n$ elements from the set, with equal probability placed all all $\begin{pmatrix}N \\ n\end{pmatrix}$ combinations of the sets. However, we are concerned with, the properties of the sample variance and sample mean, what are they and are they biased?
