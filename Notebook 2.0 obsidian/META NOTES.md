# **Important Tasks about the Notes**

Tasks that are important for something. Review, or research. 

- Fill out the part about minimizers of a convex function for [Convex Functions CENTRAL HUB](AMATH%20516%20Numerical%20Optimizations/CVX%20Analysis/Convex%20Functions%20CENTRAL%20HUB.md). 

# **Tasks to Do about the Notes**

Something to do when we have time. 

- Add/link some calculus rules for the projection, distance operator described here: [[AMATH 516 Numerical Optimizations/Background/Convex Sets Projections and Dist, Intro]]

# **Tasks that Probably Will Never Get Done**



# **TAG Systems**

- #UNFINISHED is a tag that describes unfinished works. 
- #CITATION_NEEDED need to add citations for some claims 
- #HEINZ Professor Heinz's Special Deliveries. 
- #INCORRECT  CORECT The claim is just wrong, and I don't know what is right, so I just tag it. 
- #LATER Unfinished and I don't want to work on it anytime soon. 
- #UNSOLVED Some issues, or questions that is unresolved.
