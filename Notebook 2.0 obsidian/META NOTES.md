# **Organizations**

- These files: 
	- [[MATH 601 Functional Analysis/Topology of a Continuous Mapping]]
	- [[MATH 601 Functional Analysis/Functional Spaces/Continuous Mapping in Metric Spaces]]
	- [[MATH 601 Functional Analysis/Continuous Mapping and Compactness]]
	- Need to be re-organized.

# **Important Tasks about the Notes**

Tasks that are important for something. Review, or research. 

- Fill out the part about minimizers of a convex function for [Convex Functions CENTRAL HUB](AMATH%20516%20Numerical%20Optimizations/CVX%20Analysis/Convex%20Functions%20CENTRAL%20HUB.md). 
- Clarify the concept of a level graph, and add a theorem about convex level sets for convex function for the file: [Characterizing Functions for Optimizations](AMATH%20516%20Numerical%20Optimizations/Background/Characterizing%20Functions%20for%20Optimizations.md).

# **Tasks to Do about the Notes**

Something to do when we have time. 

- Add/link some calculus rules for the projection, distance operator described here: [[AMATH 516 Numerical Optimizations/Background/Convex Sets Projections and Dist, Intro]]

# **TAG Systems**

- #UNFINISHED is a tag that describes unfinished works. 
- #CITATION_NEEDED need to add citations for some claims 
- #HEINZ Professor Heinz's Special Deliveries. 
- #INCORECT The claim is just wrong, and I don't know what is right, so I just tag it. 
- #LATER Unfinished and I don't want to work on it anytime soon. 
- #UNSOLVED Some issues, or questions that is unresolved.
