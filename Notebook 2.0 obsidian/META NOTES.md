# **Important Tasks about the Notes**
- Fill up [Functional Analysis Central Hub](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Functional%20Analysis%20Central%20Hub.md) for wrapping up elementary materials in this course. 
- Fill up a sequence of notes that describes the idea of adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces, and their applications. Files included are: 
	- [Bilinear Form, Rietz Representations](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Bilinear%20Form,%20Rietz%20Representations.md)
	- [Linear Mapping in Hilbert Space](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Linear%20Mapping%20in%20Hilbert%20Space.md)
	- [Adjoint ODE Systems](AMATH%20503%20Intro%20to%20Partial%20Differential%20Equations/Adjoint%20ODE%20Systems.md)
	- [Sturm Liouville Theory](AMATH%20503%20Intro%20to%20Partial%20Differential%20Equations/Sturm%20Liouville%20Theory.md)



# **Tasks to Do about the Notes**

Something to do when we have time. 

- Add/link some calculus rules for the projection, distance operator described here: [[AMATH 516 Numerical Optimizations/Background/Convex Sets Projections and Dist, Intro]], add them from Heinz's course notes yes. 

# **Tasks that Probably Will Never Get Done**



# **TAG Systems**

- #UNFINISHED is a tag that describes unfinished works. 
- #CITATION_NEEDED need to add citations for some claims 
- #HEINZ Professor Heinz's Special Deliveries. 
- #INCORRECT  CORECT The claim is just wrong, and I don't know what is right, so I just tag it. 
- #LATER Unfinished and I don't want to work on it anytime soon. 
- #UNSOLVED Some issues, or questions that is unresolved.
