# **Important Tasks about the Notes**

Tasks that are important for something. Review, or research. 

- Fill out the part about minimizers of a convex function for [Convex Functions Central Hub](AMATH%20516%20Numerical%20Optimizations/CVX%20Analysis/Convex%20Functions%20Central%20Hub.md).

# **Tasks to Do about the Notes**

Something to do when we have time. 

- Add/link some calculus rules for the projection, distance operator described here: [[AMATH 516 Numerical Optimizations/Background/Convex Sets Projections and Dist, Intro]]
