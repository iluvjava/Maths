This note is a note about notes. 

# **Organizations**

- These files: 
	- [Finite Dimensional Normed Space](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Functional%20Spaces/Finite%20Dimensional%20Normed%20Space.md), contains some theorems and statements that are generalized to, Banach and Metric spaces, separate them to different files. 
		- There is one lemma, the Rietz Lemma, which is about Banach space in general, take that out to [Banach Space Introduction](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Functional%20Spaces/Banach%20Space%20Introduction.md) or somewhere better. 
		- There is one theorem about compactness and continuous mapping, it's for metric space and continuous mapping. 
	- Fill up the file [Continuous Linear Transform](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Continuous%20Linear%20Transform.md), with the correct information. 

# **Important Tasks about the Notes**
- Fill up [Functional Analysis Central Hub](MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Functional%20Analysis%20Central%20Hub.md) for wrapping up elementary materials in this course. 


# **Tasks to Do about the Notes**

Something to do when we have time. 

- Add/link some calculus rules for the projection, distance operator described here: [[AMATH 516 Numerical Optimizations/Background/Convex Sets Projections and Dist, Intro]], add them from Heinz's course notes yes. 

# **Tasks that Probably Will Never Get Done**



# **TAG Systems**

- #UNFINISHED is a tag that describes unfinished works. 
- #CITATION_NEEDED need to add citations for some claims 
- #HEINZ Professor Heinz's Special Deliveries. 
- #INCORRECT  CORECT The claim is just wrong, and I don't know what is right, so I just tag it. 
- #LATER Unfinished and I don't want to work on it anytime soon. 
- #UNSOLVED Some issues, or questions that is unresolved.
