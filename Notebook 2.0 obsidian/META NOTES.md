# **Organizations**

- We might want to split [[AMATH 516 Numerical Optimizations/Non-Smooth Calculus/Subgradient Definition]] into 2 files, one for the classical convex subgradient, and the other one for modern variational subgradient. 

- These files: 
	- [[MATH 601 Functional Analysis/Topology of a Continuous Mapping]]
	- [[MATH 601 Functional Analysis/Functional Spaces/Continuous Mapping in Metric Spaces]]
	- [[MATH 601 Functional Analysis/Continuous Mapping and Compactness]]
	- Need to be re-organized.

# **Important Tasks about the Notes**

Tasks that are important for something. Review, or research. 

---
# **Tasks to To about the Notes**

Something to do when we have time. 

- Add/link some calculus rules for the projection, distance operator described here: [[AMATH 516 Numerical Optimizations/Background/Convex Sets Projections and Dist, Intro]]
