### **Intro**


**References**
1. \<Large-scale convex Optimizations: Algorithms and analysis via Monotone Operators\> by Ernest K. Ryu & Wotao Yin. A very complicate textbook, which should serve as primary references. 
2. \<A Primier on Monotone Operators\>, this one is a really good one! The collections are extremely good.  See [Primer on Monotone Operators](../MATH%20999%20Paper%20Reviews%20and%20Frontier%20Mathematics/References%20Sep%202022/Primer%20on%20Monotone%20Operators.pdf) for more.
