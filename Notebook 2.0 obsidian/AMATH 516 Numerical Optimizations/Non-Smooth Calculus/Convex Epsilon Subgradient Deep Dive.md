### **Intro**

A lot of results, and algorithms had been established for convex epsilon subgradient. 
In this file, we will take a careful look into it.

### **Calculus Rules of $\epsilon$-subgradient**

The epsilon subgradient admits calculus rules similar to the convex subgradient.

### **Duality of $\epsilon$-subgradient**

The inexact subgradient reflect duality, and as a result, the Moreau decompositions as well.
