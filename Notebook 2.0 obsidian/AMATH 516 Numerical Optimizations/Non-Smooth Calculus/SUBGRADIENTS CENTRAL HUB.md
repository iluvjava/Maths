### **Other Properties that I haven't had time to write**

* The gradient is a closed operator when the function $f$ is closed and convex (Closed Subgradient When Convex Proper). 
	* The graph of the subgradient operator for a closed convex function $f$ is also a closed set, meaning that the set $\{(x, v)\in \mathbb E \times \mathbb E: v \in \partial [f](v)\}$ is a closed set.

### **Variational Subgradient**

In this section, we expand some of the classic calculus rules for convex subdifferentials. We prove and cite their classics source.
