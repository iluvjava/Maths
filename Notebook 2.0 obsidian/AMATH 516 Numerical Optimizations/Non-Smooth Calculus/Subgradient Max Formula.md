### **Intro**

Optimizing over a specific direction over the subgradient set yields the value of directional derivative, assuming convexity for the functions. 

**Thm: The max Formula**
> Let $f$ be convex proper on $X$, suppose that $x\in \text{int.dom}(f)$, let $d\in X$. Then 
> 
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
>     f'(x; d) = \max \langle d, \partial f(x)\rangle = \sigma_{\partial f(x)}(d). 
> \end{aligned}
> $$

**Proof**: 
skipped for now.
