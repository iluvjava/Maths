### **Intro**

Combining Bregman divergence and Proximal mapping, we can create a descent lemma analogous to gradient descent with globally Lipschitz smooth function. 
See [L-Smoothness as an Implication of Globally Lipschitz Gradient Under Convexity](Global%20Lipschitz%20Gradient,%20Strong%20Smoothness,%20Equivalence%20and%20Implications.md) for more information about that.
The results and characterizations are also similar. 
These servers as a basis for the mirror descent algorithm. 
For this part we take heavy references from paper by Heinz et al[^1].
