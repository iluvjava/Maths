### **Intro**

We are in Hilbert space. 
We discuss fixed point iterations of a non-expansive operator when: 
1. It has a fixed point set. 
2. It doesn't have a fixed point set. 

When it has a fixed point set, the iteration may not converge to the fixed point set. 
A basic counter example would be the minus identity operator. 
Therefore, use [Krasnoselskii Mann Iteration](Krasnoselskii%20Mann%20Iteration.md) to look for the fixed point set of the Non-expansive operator. 
The difficulty part is that even if the fixed point set of the Non-expansive operator is empty, there is still convergence for the operator.
