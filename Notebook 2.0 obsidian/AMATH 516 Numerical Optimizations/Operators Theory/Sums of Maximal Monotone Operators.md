### **Intro**

Let $A, B$ be monotone operators, then the summed operator $A + B$ is a monotone operators.
However it doesn't happen in general that if $A, B$ are maximally monotone operators, then $A + B$ are maximally monotone operators.
Recall that the fact that subgradient of a convex function is a maximally monotone operator. 
Then we can reuse the same counter example presented in [Subgradient Sum Rule](Subgradient%20Sum%20Rule.md) because the subgradients presented there are maximally monotone operators.
