### **Intro**

We continue the saga of monotone operators in a separate files. 
The class of monotone operator is huge in Hilbert space and it has profound theorems. 
This writing will exposes references to some of the deeper theorems of monotone operators, and we prove some of them if they are appropriate.

### **Minty's Surjectivity Theorem**

We introduce the star of this file. 

#### **Thm | Minty's Surjectivity Theorem for Maximally Monotone Operator**
> Let $A$ be a multi-valued mapping on some Hilbert space: $\mathcal H$, and $A$ is monotone. Then $A$ is *maximal monotone* if and only if $\text{ran}(I + A) = \mathcal H$ (The operator is surjective). 

**Proof**
For a proof and discussion of the theorem, visit [Minty's Theorem, The Surjectivity Theorem](Minty's%20Theorem,%20The%20Surjectivity%20Theorem.md).
