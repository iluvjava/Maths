### **Intro**

Due to the fact that there are so much things with operators, and monotone operator, here we will summarized them here. 
When we refer to operators, we are referring to a set-valued mapping that maps from $X \mapsto 2^X$ where $X$ is a Hilbert Space in our context. 
See [Hilbert Space Introduction](Hilbert%20Space%20Introduction.md) for more info about a Hilbert space.

### **Monotone and Maximally Monotone Operator**

Maximally monotone operator can be resolvent that are invertible. 
Maximally monotone operator could be the subgradient of a convex function. 
Monotone operator could be the subgradient of the Lagrangian. 
We list discussion relevant to monotone operators.

### **Lipschitz Operator**

Lipschitz operator bound the distance between 2 points in the output space of the operator wrt the input space. 
See for an example, [Lipschitz Operator in Euclidean Space](Lipschitz%20Operator%20in%20Euclidean%20Space.md). 
In practice, we actually want [Firmly Nonexpansive Operators](Firmly%20Nonexpansive%20Operators.md), which is a type of operations that has a Lipschitz constant that is less than or equal to one. 
Under the best case we want to deal with operator that creates a contraction, see [Banach Contraction](../../MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis,%20Measure%20Theory/Functional%20Spaces/Banach%20Contraction%20in%20Metric%20Space%20) for more information. 


#### **Topic | Non-Expansive Operator**
> The non-expansive operator has to be Lipschitz first and it has to be $X\mapsto X$, a , as a result, it has to be a single-valued mapping. 
> A non-expansive operator has a Lipschitz constant of exactly $1$.
