### **Intro**

Cayley's transform is something quite general. It's in linear algebra, but at the same time, it's also in operator theory with much general results. 

**Definition: (Linear Algebra)** 

> $U$ is unitary matrices in $M_n$ is iff $U = (I + iK)^{-1}(I - iK)$ for some Hermitian matrix $K$. 

**Observations**
 - $K$ is Hermitian iff $iK$ is skew hermitian. 
 


**Remark**

In Heinz's book, the Cayley's transform is referred to as: *the-reflected resolvent*.
