### **Intro**

A compact set is closed and bounded. It will have no holes in it and it will contain all of its limit points. When a set $A$ is bounded we simply mean there exists a real number and a metric system that bound $|x - y|$ for all $x, y \in A$. For more about closed sets, refers too [[Topological Basics for Optimizations]]. It's basically saying that a closed sets contains all its limit point, giving it a well defined boundary too.
