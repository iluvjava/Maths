### **Intro**

We define continuous set limits using the subsequences characterizations. 
Recall that subsequence $\mathcal N_\infty^\#$ is the set of all subsequences of the sequence of natural numbers. 
Denote $\mathcal N_\infty$ to be the set of subsequences of natural number such that it only differs on finite many positions. 
With these, we are ready to introduce the definitions for the outer/inner limit of a sequences of sets in ambience space $\mathbb R^n$.
