### **Intro**

Limit can be defined for a set and it's useful for the concept of epigraphical limit introduced by Rockafellar. Rockafellar is especially interested in limiting processing defined for convex optimization where $\lim_{v\rightarrow \infty}\inf_v(f^{(v)}(x))$ is preserved under the operations.
