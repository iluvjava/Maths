[[Characterizing Functions for Optimizations]]

---
### **Intro**

The following operations applied on a closed function will result in a new function that is still closed. Let $\{f_n\}_{n = 1}^m$  be a list of augmented real functions that are all closed. Consider a linear mapping denoted as $\mathcal A$ that maps between 2 euclidean spaces denoted as $\mathbb E, \mathbb V$. Then we know that: 

1. $f(\mathcal Ax + b)$ is closed. 
2. let $\{\alpha_i\in \mathbb R_+\}_{i = 1}^m$ then $\sum_{i = 1}^{m}f_i(x)$ is closed. 
3. $\max_{i\in [m]}f_i(x)$ is closed. 


**Proof**

#UNFINISHED : Skippppped for later. 




**Remarks**

It's somewhat similar to the convexity preserving operations. 

> Due to the fact that Epigraph is a spacial type of set, the same thing cannot be said for $S\subseteq \mathbb E$. The intersections and linear pre-images of closed sets are closed, sums, linear images, and linear scaling of closed sets need not to be closed in general.
