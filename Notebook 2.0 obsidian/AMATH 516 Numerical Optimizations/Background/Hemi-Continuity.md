### **Intro**

We take references from [Hemicontinuity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicontinuity#Sequential_characterization). 
Hemi-continuity considers set-valued mappings mapping between topological spaces $A, B$. 
Let's assume that $F: A \rightarrow 2^B$ is such mutivalued mapping. 
Under this setting, we are ready to define the concept of continuity on this mapping.
