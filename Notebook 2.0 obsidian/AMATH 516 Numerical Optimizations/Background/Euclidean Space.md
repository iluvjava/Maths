[[Finite Euclidean Inner Product]]

---
### **Def**: 

Finite dimensional vector spaces with an inner product defined over it. Just anything that is axiomatically equivalent to $\mathbb{R}^n$, but $n$ has to be a natural number. It's usually denoted by $\mathbb E$. The space would be introduced with the following things: 

* [Vector Space](../../MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Functional%20Spaces/Vector%20Space.md). 
* [Inner Product Space](../../MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Functional%20Spaces/Inner%20Product%20Space.md).
