### **Intro** 

The gradient of some functions, if it's nonexpansive if and only if it's firmly nonexpansive. 

#### **Theorem | Baillon Haddad Theorem**
> Let $f:X\mapsto \R$ be convex and differentiable, then $\nabla f$ is nonexpansive if and only if $\nabla f$ is firmly nonexpansive. 

**Proof**

See conditions **(C6)** in [Convex Function with Globally Lipschitz Gradient](Properties%20of%20Functions/Convex%20Function%20with%20Globally%20Lipschitz%20Gradient.md). 
It's proved there.
