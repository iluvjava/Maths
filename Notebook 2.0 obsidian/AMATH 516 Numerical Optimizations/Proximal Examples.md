[[Moreau Envelope and Proximal Mapping]]

### **Intro**

The ability to solve proximal operator for functions gives fast implementations of algorithm, and in here, we discover some of the more common proximal operators for functions. I have an old notes that talks about it: [[Proximal Gradient Method]].
