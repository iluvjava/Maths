[[Moreau Envelope and Proximal Mapping]]


---
### **Intro**

Assume that the function $f$ is convex, lsc and proper and we have access to the subgradient oracle of the function, then the proximal point method: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    x^{(t + 1)}\in \text{prox}_{f, \alpha}(x^{(t)})
\end{aligned}
$$
can be interpreted as: 
1. Gradient on the Moreau envelope. 
2. Fixed point iterations on the subgradient operator.
3. Backward Euler on the gradient dynamics involving the subgradient oracle. [[Projected Gradient via Gradient Dynamics Euler's Method]] for more.
