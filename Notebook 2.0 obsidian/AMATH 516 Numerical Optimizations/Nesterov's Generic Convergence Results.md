### **Intro**

We prove the convergence rate by faithfully follow Nesterov's book on chapter 2. We show the convergence of his generic method as well. We first present a generic results which doesn't necessarily requires knowledge about the sequence $\lambda_k, \alpha_k$. Based on that results we then find a convergence rate of the generic algorithm proposed earlier for the class of convex functions.
