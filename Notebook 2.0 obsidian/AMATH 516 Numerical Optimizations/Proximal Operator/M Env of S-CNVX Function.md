### **Intro**

This section expose properties of the Moreau Envelope of a function that is strongly convex. 
It is motivated by the Gradient descent on Moreau envelope interpretation of the proximal point method, see [Proximal Point Method, Interpretations](../Proximal%20Methods/Proximal%20Point%20Method,%20Interpretations.md) for more information.
