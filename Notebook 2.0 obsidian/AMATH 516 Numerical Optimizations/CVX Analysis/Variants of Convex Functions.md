### **Intro**

The concepts of convexity can be strengthen to subclasses of convex function, it generalized beyond the class of convex functions. 
The content of this file be based on Chapter 10 of "Convex Analysis and Monotone Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces" by Heinz, Combettes.

### **Uniformly convex function**

Uniformly convex function weakens strong convexity and generalizes convexity.
