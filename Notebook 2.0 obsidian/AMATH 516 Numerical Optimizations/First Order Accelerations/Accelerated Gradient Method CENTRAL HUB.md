### **FBS With Accelerations**

In Amir Beck's writing, we have: 
- [[Proximal Gradient with Momentum Accelerations]],
	- Amir Beck, Toubelle's original 2009 paper. 
	- [[A Better Proof for FISTA Convergence]]
		- Deriving the sequence as well as the convergence 
- [V-FISTA](../../MATH%20602%20Nesterov%20Acceleration/V-FISTA.md)
	- A variant of FISTA for strong convexity. 

In Nesterov's Writing we have
- [Nesterov Original Conception of Momentum Method](../../MATH%20602%20Nesterov%20Acceleration/Nesterov%20Original%20Conception%20of%20Momentum%20Method.md)
	- Nesterov's estimating sequences and functions . 
	- Generic momentum method derived. 
	- Non-smoothness combined.
