### **Intro**

This file replaces [Strong Convexity LEGACY](Strong%20Convexity%20LEGACY.md). 
Some of the contents will be re-written and stated in a clear manner. 

#### **Definition | strongly convex function**
> $f: Q \rightarrow \R^n$ is $\alpha$ strongly convex if and only if $f - \alpha/2\Vert \cdot\Vert^2$ is a convex function. 

Recall the following results from ???

#### **Theorem | Subgradient Characterization of convexity**
