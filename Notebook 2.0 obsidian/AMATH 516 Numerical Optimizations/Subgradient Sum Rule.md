[[Non-Smooth Calculus/Subgradient Intro]]

### **Intro**

Here we prove provide counter example for the converse case and establishes the  strong and the weak subgradient sum rule and characterize their conditions. This one is a very important subgradient rule, preluding the huge development of variational analysis.

### **Convex Subgradient Sum Rule**

The subgradient sum rule is true when functions are convex.
