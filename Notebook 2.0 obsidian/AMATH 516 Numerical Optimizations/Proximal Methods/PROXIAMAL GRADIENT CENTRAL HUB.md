# Intro

This file attempts to bind all the files related to: Proximal Gradient type of methods. 

- [[FISTA_ A Fast Iterative Shrinka - Amir Beck.pdf]]
	- The original FISTA from Amir Beck, stolen the idea from Nestrov, proof is very similar too. 
- [[Proximal Gradient Convergence Rate]], This is an elementary proof for the convergence rate of the proximal gradient algorithm. 
- [[Proximal Gradient, Forward Backwards Envelope]]
	- Surrogate. 
	- Forward Backward Envelope.
	- Gradient of the Envelope. 
- [[Proximal Gradient with Momentum Accelerations]],
	- Amirc Beck, Toubelle's original 2009 paper. 
	- [[A Better Proof for FISTA Convergence]]
		- Deriving the sequence as well as the convergence 
- [V-FISTA](../../MATH%20602%20Nesterov%20Acceleration/V-FISTA.md)

### **Very Old Notes**
Here are some of the old notes I had for the topics, these are from Sasha's teaching: 
- [Proximal Gradient Method](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%20Method.md)
- [Proximal Gradient 2](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%202.md), 
- [Proximal Gradient FISTA](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%20FISTA.md)
