# Intro

This file attempts to bind all the files related to: Proximal Gradient type of methods. 

- [[FISTA_ A Fast Iterative Shrinka - Amir Beck.pdf]]
	- The original FISTA from Amir Beck, stolen the idea from Nestrov, proof is very similar too. 
- [[Proximal Gradient Convergence Rate]], This is an elementary proof for the convergence rate of the proximal gradient algorithm. 
- [[Proximal Gradient, Forward Backwards Envelope]]
	- Surrogate. 
	- Forward Backward Envelope.
	- Gradient of the Envelope.

### **Accelerations**

The method of Proximal gradient has acceleration variants, but they are complicated. 
See [Accelerated Gradient Method CENTRAL HUB](Accelerated%20Gradient%20Method%20CENTRAL%20HUB.md) for more information.

### **Very Old Notes**
Here are some of the old notes I had for the topics, these are from Sasha's teaching: 
- [Proximal Gradient Method](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%20Method.md)
- [Proximal Gradient 2](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%202.md), 
- [Proximal Gradient FISTA](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%20FISTA.md)
