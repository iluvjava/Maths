### **Intro**

This file attempts to bind all the files related to: Proximal Gradient type of methods. 

- [[FISTA_ A Fast Iterative Shrinka - Amir Beck.pdf]], This is the original, classical paper published by Amir's Beck to show the convergence and some application of the accelerated proximal gradient method.  
- [[Proximal Gradient Convergence Rate]], This is an elementary proof for the convergence rate of the proximal gradient algorithm. 
- [[Proximal Gradient via Forward Backwards Envelope]], this is an introduction to the proximal gradient algorithm via the ideal of a forward backward envelope, an upper model is constructed, which is called the envelope. 
- [[Proximal Gradient with Momentum Accelerations]], We review and follow closely with Beck's Paper and their proof. 
	- [[A Better Proof for FISTA Convergence]], we present a new better proof where, the properties of the momentum weights are, derived along with the convergence rate.
