# Intro

This file attempts to bind all the files related to: Proximal Gradient type of methods. 

- [[FISTA_ A Fast Iterative Shrinka - Amir Beck.pdf]], This is the original, classical paper published by Amir's Beck to show the convergence and some application of the accelerated proximal gradient method.  
- [[Proximal Gradient Convergence Rate]], This is an elementary proof for the convergence rate of the proximal gradient algorithm. 
- [[Proximal Gradient, Forward Backwards Envelope]], this is an introduction to the proximal gradient algorithm via the ideal of a forward backward envelope, an upper model is constructed, which is called the envelope. 
- [[Proximal Gradient with Momentum Accelerations]], We review and follow closely with Beck's Paper and their proof. 
	- [[A Better Proof for FISTA Convergence]], we present a new better proof where, the properties of the momentum weights are, derived along with the convergence rate. 
- [V-FISTA](../../V-FISTA.md), a Variant of FISTA algorithm for Additive composites of $g, h$, a smooth and strongly convex function and a $h$ convex function that is Prox friendly. 


Here are some of the old notes I had for the topics, these are from Sasha's teaching: 
- [Proximal Gradient Method](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%20Method.md)
- [Proximal Gradient 2](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%202.md), 
- [Proximal Gradient FISTA](../../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Proximal%20Gradient%20Descend/Proximal%20Gradient%20FISTA.md)
