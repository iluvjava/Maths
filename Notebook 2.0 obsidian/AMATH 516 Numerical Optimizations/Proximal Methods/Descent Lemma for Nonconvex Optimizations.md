### **Intro**

We will talk about the 3 people paper with Attouch, Bolte [^1]. 
In this paper, a frameworks involved the used of a descent lemma is proposed. 
The convergence rate is not discussed in depth, but the convergence of the iterates to critical points of the function had been discussed in details.
