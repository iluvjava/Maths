[[Proximal Gradient Convergence Rate]]


---
### **Intro**

A thorough understanding of the Proximal Gradient without momentum is needed to understand this. This part of the text will make heavy references to Amir's Beck's book, and the paper [[FISTA_ A Fast Iterative Shrinka - Amir Beck.pdf]], and then the Presentation from L. Vanderberghe [here](https://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/236C/lectures/fgrad.pdf) on Nesterov momentum method. In this excerp, we will state the algorithm for the FISTA, and then we will attempt to prove the convergence rate while knowing the algorithm. And at the end we will try to discuss some of the magics behind sequence of numbers for the algorithm.
