### **Intro**

This file attempts to bind all the files related to: FISTA

- [[FISTA_ A Fast Iterative Shrinka - Amir Beck.pdf]]
- [[Proximal Gradient Convergence Rate]]
- [[Proximal Gradient via Forward Backwards Envelope]]
- [[Proximal Gradient with Momentum Accelerations]], We review and follow closely with Beck's Paper and their proof. 
	- [[A Better Proof for FISTA Convergence]], we present a new better proof where, the properties of the momentum weights are, derived along with the convergence rate.
