### **Intro**

We will introduce a framework of ideas for show the convergence of sequences applied to a function satisfying the KL property. 
Our discussion is based on a paper by Attouch et al. [^1]

---
### **Conditions | The Convergence Conditions**

We state the conditions of descent and their consequences. 
We have to delay putting up the proof, maybe we will add the proof in a later time. 

#### **Condition 1 | Descent Condition**

#### **Condition 2 | Relative Error**

#### **Condition 3 | Continuity**
