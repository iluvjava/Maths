### **Intro**

A comprehensive guide for proximal 
Inequality. 
For Proximal Gradient inequality, a specialized type of proximal inequality with additive smooth and nonsmooth objective, visits [Fundamental Proximal Gradient Inequality](AMATH%20516%20Numerical%20Optimizations/Proximal%20Methods/Fundamental%20Proximal%20Gradient%20Inequality.md). 

**Notations and Assumptions**
1. 

From the introductory materials, we know of the following equivalent conditions.
