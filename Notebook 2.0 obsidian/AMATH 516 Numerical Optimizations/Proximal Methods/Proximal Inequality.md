### **Intro**

A comprehensive guide for proximal 
Inequality. 
For Proximal Gradient inequality, a specialized type of proximal inequality with additive smooth and nonsmooth objective, visits [Fundamental Proximal Gradient Inequality](AMATH%20516%20Numerical%20Optimizations/Proximal%20Methods/Fundamental%20Proximal%20Gradient%20Inequality.md). 

The following theorem restated the proximal inequality for a convex function $f: \R^n \rightarrow \overline \R$. 

#### **Theorem | Proximal inequality**

### **Quadratic function growth of the Model function**

Proximal inequality is an inequality that relates the output of the proximal operators to the subgradient.
It can be generalize to other nonconvex settings.
