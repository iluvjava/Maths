### **Intro**

A comprehensive guide for the proximal Inequality. 
For Proximal Gradient inequality, a specialized type of proximal inequality with additive smooth and nonsmooth objective, visits [Proximal Gradient Inequality Part I](Proximal%20Gradient%20Inequality%20Part%20I.md). 

The following theorem restated the proximal inequality for a convex function $f: \R^n \rightarrow \overline \R$.

### **Quadratic function growth of the Model function**

Proximal inequality is an inequality that relates the output of the proximal operators to the subgradient.
It can be generalize to other nonconvex settings.
