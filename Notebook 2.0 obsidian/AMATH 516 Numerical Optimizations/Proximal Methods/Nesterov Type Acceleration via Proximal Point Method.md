### **Intro**

We use the descent inequality and Lyapunov frameworks proposed in [Proximal Point Method, Convex](Proximal%20Point%20Method,%20Convex.md) to derive the method to derive a specific form of the accelerated gradient. 
We will also prove the convergence rate of the method and deduce the optimal step sizes. 
Before we start, we set up the stage by setting up some quantities that are useful for our derivations later. 

- $f:\R^n \mapsto \overline \R$ is a convex function.
