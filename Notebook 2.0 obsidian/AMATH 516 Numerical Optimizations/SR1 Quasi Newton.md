### **Intro**

Newton's iterations in multiple dimensions has difficulty for computations. There has been much endeavors into quasi-newton methods. A quasi newton's method approximates the second derivative/Hessian instead of computing it, avoiding the complexity of computations. THe idea of the algorithm dates back, all the way back to 1950 by Davidson.
