We will define the flux, in the most generic and general way possible. 
prereq: [[Surfaces]]. We need to set up a surface in a force field first, before we define the idea of the flux on the surface.

### Def

> $$\iint \vec{F}\cdot \vec{n} \;dS$$

So we go over the surface, and then for each of the tiny bit of vector in the vector field, we dot them with the vector normal to the force field, and then we just sum them up and then we have the surface integral.
