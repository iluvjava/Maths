[[Group Basics]]

### **Intro**

A given group can be factored by the following entities: 
1. Equivalent relations. 
2. Homomorphism.
3. Normal Subgroups. 

An example of an Equivalent relations define as the additive modulo is in [[Prime Examples for Group]]. 


### **Partitioning via Subgroup**
A subgroup $H$ of $G$ can be used to partition the group $G$ into sets of equal number of elements. Let $(G, \triangleleft)$ be a group and $H\subseteq G$ be a subgroup. We may just wright $a\triangleleft b$ as $ab$ for better notations. 

#### **Definition | Coset**
> The left coset of $G$ induced by subgroup $H$ is $gH := \{g\triangleleft h | h \in H\}$, the right coset is similarly defined as $Hg = \{h\triangleleft g | h \in H\}$. 


The definition of a cosets allows for the definition of a normal subgroup of the group. 

#### **Definition | Normal Subgroup**
> $N\preceq G$ is a normal subgroup if $N$ is a subgroup and for any $a\in G$, the cosets $aN = Na$.

**Observation**

It's a subgroup such that all its element commute with all the other elements from the group.

**Note**:

The $\{e\}, G$ are examples of trivial normal subgroups, they are also the improper subgroups of $G$. To show that a subgroup.
