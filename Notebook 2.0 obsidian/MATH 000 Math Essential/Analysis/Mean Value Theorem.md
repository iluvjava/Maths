### **Intro**
It's also referred to as the Rolle's theorem sometimes. 
Because it's elementary it's in [Wikipedia here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolle%27s_theorem). 

#### **Theorem | Rolle's theorem**
> Suppose $f: [a, b] \rightarrow \R$ is continuous and has derivative $f':(a, b) \rightarrow \R$ continuous as well. 
> If $f(a) = f(b) = 0$, then there exists $c \in [a, b]$ such that $f(c) = 0$. 

**Proof**

**Remarks**

Continuity of the derivative is crucial. 
A discontinuous derivative would be outside the content of elementary analysis. 


#### **Theorem | Intermediate value theorem**
> Suppose $f: [a, b] \rightarrow \R$ is continuous and has derivative $f':(a, b) \rightarrow \R$ continuous as well. 
> then there exists $c \in [a, b]$ such that $f'(c)(a - b) = f(a) - f(b)$.
