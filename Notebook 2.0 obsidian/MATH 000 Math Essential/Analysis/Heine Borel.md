### **Intro**

The theorem is rooted in topology and it defines compactness in topological spaces, and it only becomes closed and bounded in finite Euclidean spaces. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem) for more info. 

In finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, the theorem states the equivalence between closed and bounded condition, and existence of sub-sequential convergence.
