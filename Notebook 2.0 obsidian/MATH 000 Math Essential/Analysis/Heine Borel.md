### **Intro**

The theorem is rooted in topology and it defines compactness in topological spaces, and it only becomes closed and bounded in finite Euclidean spaces. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heine%E2%80%93Borel_theorem) for more info. In Metric space, the theorem states the equivalence between closed and bounded condition, and existence of sub-sequential convergence. For form information regarding the last claim, see [Compactness in Metric Spaces](../../MATH%20601%20Functional%20Analysis/Functional%20Spaces/Compactness%20in%20Metric%20Spaces.md) for more details.
