### **Intro**

**Definition: Cauchy Sequence**

> $(a_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$ is a cauchy sequence then for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $m, n$ such that whenever $\min(m, n) \ge N_\epsilon$ then $|a_n - a_m|\le \epsilon$. In brief, any 2 points that is sufficiently large can get as close as we want. 

Immediately observe that if a sequence is convergence, then it has to be a Cauchy sequence. 

**Remarks**

In general metric space, this theorem still works well.

### **Convergence of Cauchy Sequence**

> If a sequence $a_n$ is Cauchy, then it converges. We don't know what it converges to.
