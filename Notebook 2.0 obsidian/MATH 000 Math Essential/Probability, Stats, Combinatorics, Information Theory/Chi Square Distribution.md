### **Intro**

The chi-square distribution are used for testing the amount of deviations for a series of normal distributions that are Mutually Independent. The random variable $X_n$ has $\chi(k)$ when 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X_n = \sum_{k = 1}^{n} \frac{(N_k - \mu_k)^2}{\sigma_k}, N_k \sim N(\mu_k, \sigma), 
\end{aligned}
$$
