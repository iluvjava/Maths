### **Intro**

Suppose that $X$ is a continuous random variable with a PDF $f_X$, CDF(PMF) $F_X$ on all reals, then the expected value of the random variable $X$ would be 

1. $$\mathbb{E}\left[X\right] = \int_{\mathbb R} x f(x)dx$$ 
    when the variable is continuous and with a PDF. 
2. $$\mathbb{E}\left[X\right] = \sum_{x\in \Omega}^{} x p_X(x)$$ 
    when $X$ is discrete. 
3. $$\mathbb{E}\left[X\right] = \sum_{k\in \mathbb N}^{}\mathbb P(X \ge k)$$ 
    when $X$ is a discrete random variable. 

The above list is not a definition, but rather some way we can compute the expected value of a functon. And take notice that, the expected value for a random variable is just the average value a random varaible would take.
