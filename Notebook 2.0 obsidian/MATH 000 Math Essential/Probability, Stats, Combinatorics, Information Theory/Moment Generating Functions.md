### **Intro**

A moment generating function is like the Laplace transform for the probability mass functions of a random variables. See [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment-generating_function) for a comprehensive overview of this big topic. In this file, we define it, point out some of its properties, and then show some simple examples/applications of the concept.
