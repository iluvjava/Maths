### **Intro**

We follow chapter 4 of the "Statistics for Mathematicians: A First Course". We discuss the full context for hypothesis testing with knowledge from MLE, and then we introduce the Naymen Pearson Frameworks for hypothesis testing followed by concrete ways of constructing the crition for statistics and ways for looking for the best test functions for those statistics.
