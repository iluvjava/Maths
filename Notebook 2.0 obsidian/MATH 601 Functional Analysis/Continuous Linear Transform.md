[[Continuous Mapping]]

---
### **Intro**

We discuss the properties that describes linear mapping that is continuous. In the case of infinite dimensional mapping in the Banach space, a linear mapping doesn't have to be continuous. In the case of derivative as a linear transformations, $\sqrt{x}$ is a point where such operator is continuous at. 

**Theorems**:

Let $T$ be a linear mapping between the functional space $X, Y$, which are Banach Space. Then the following theorems are equivalent: 

* $T$ is continuous. 
* $T$ is continuous at $\mathbf 0$. 
* There exists $M > 0$ such that for all $x \in X$, $\Vert Tx\Vert \ge M\Vert X\Vert_X$.
