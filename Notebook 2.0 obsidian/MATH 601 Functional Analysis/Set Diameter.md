### **Intro**

**Definition: Diameter of a set**: 
> Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Then the diameter of a subset $M\subseteq X$ is defined as: $\text{diam}(M):= \sup_{x\in M, y\in M}d(x, y)$. The longest distance for any pairs of point from the set $M$. 

**Observations**

- Singleton set has a diameter of zero. 
- If $A \subseteq B \subseteq X$, then $\text{diam}(A)\ge \text{diam}(B)$ by the property of $\sup$. 
- It meansures how close a set is to a single set. It's a measure of size under the metric analogous to cardinality.
