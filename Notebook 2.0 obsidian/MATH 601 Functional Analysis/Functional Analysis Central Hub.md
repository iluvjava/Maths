### **Intro**

Functional analysis is just calculus and linear algebra but in generalized spaces such as the normed spaces and Hilbert spaces. The theories goes deep and establishes theorems for spaces such as $C[a, b]$, continuous function over an interval, and $L^2[a, b]$, all Lesbgue Integral functions over the interval $[a, b]$.

The whole course is kinda based on: 
1. Kryzig's Introduction to Functional analysis. 
2. Notes from Professor Wang for the Math 328 that teaches Analysis II at UBCO. 
3. Various sources on the internet.
