### **Intro**

A Banach space where, the basis to span each element has finitely many elements in it. We will prove that, a vector space with norm, spanned by a finite basis set is indeed, complete, hence Banach. The major consequences are equivalences between all norms, and, completeness of all subspaces and spaces. 

**Lemma: Lower Bound of Linear Independent Basis**
