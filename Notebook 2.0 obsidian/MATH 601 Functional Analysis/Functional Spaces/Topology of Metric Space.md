### **Intro**

Separability, Denseness, and completeness of the Metric Spaces and their derivatives. For the introduction, we define some of the concepts and then use theorems to paint a better picture for the topologies inside of a metric space. 

To start, we define the concept of vicinity around any "point" in the metric space. Given $(X, d)$, we then define 

**Definition: An Open set**
> $A\subseteq X$ is open when for all $x\in A$ there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $\mathbb B_\epsilon(x)\in A$. 

**Definition: A Closed Set**
> $A\subseteq X$ is closed when $X\setminus A$ is open. 



**Definition:Dense Subset**

> A subset $A\subseteq X$ is dense when $\text{cl}(A) = X$.
