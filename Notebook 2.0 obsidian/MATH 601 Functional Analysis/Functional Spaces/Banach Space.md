[[Vector Space]]

### **Banach Space**

[Banach space](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BanachSpace.html) is a complete normed [[Vector Space]], which makes it a [[Metric Space]]. It's a set of elements that can form a complete  vector space with a norm calculations.  **Note**: The "complete" in this context is referring to closure under Cauchy Sequence, not interpreted as "complete with".


**Banach But not Hilbert**
> It's implied from the definition, that, there exists instances of Banach Space that is not Hilbert Space. Such a space would have norm that is not defined via inner product, unlike a [[Hilbert Space]] where it has its norm defined via the inner product of elements. 


**Lacks of Inner Product**
> The definition doesn't said anything about  using inner product in the space to define the norm metric. The norm can be independent of the inner product.
