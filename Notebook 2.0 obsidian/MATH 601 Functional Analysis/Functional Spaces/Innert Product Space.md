[[Vector Space]]

### **Intro**

An Inner product space is a vector space the is together with an inner product defined with it. However, if the vector space is a complete space, then this makes no difference with [[Hilbert Space]]. 

**Inner Product might Differ**: 

> However, there are also subtleties that come with the idea of inner product. See [[Inner Product Axiomatically Defined]] for a detailed covered. Depending on the scalar field of the vector field, the choice of inner product might differ. Both semi-inner product and product space are fine for the theory I believe. 


**Definition-1 | Inner Product Space**

> Let $X$ be an inner product space then it first has to equip with $\Vert \cdot\Vert$, and inner product mapping $\langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle$ such that $\Vert x\Vert = \sqrt{\langle x, x\rangle}$.

### **The Parallelogram Equality**

There is one exciting new features that got added into Inner Product space compare to just a normed space. The geometry now contains some elements of triangles and some type of orthogonality between elements from the underlying vector space. For more context see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram_law) for this law, it's somewhat wellknown.
