[[Metric Space]]

### **Intro**
Wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence), A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence (Using a defined metric) using element from the set has a limit that is in the set itself.  At first read, it's very easy to confuse the concept with a closure of a set, in a topological sense. And here is the relation: 
> A complete subspace must be closed. But a closed subspace need not to be complete. (I am not sure how this work actually #UNFINISHED )
