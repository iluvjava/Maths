### **Intro**

The virtue of the class is to glance into probability theory that is based on measure theory, it's for Phd student in the field of Engineering and Applied Math to understand papers arise in the field of Probability Theory. 

The notes here will be based on these 2 classes that I had taken: 
1. Introduction to probability theory, AMATH 561 at UW. 
2. Stochastic processes at UBCO. 
3. Self-reading on these topics.
