### **Gaslighting the Readers and Audiences**

When writing mathematical literature, it's a joyful activity to gaslight the readers to doubt their skills in various ways. To achieve that, simply apply some of these phrases when appropriate. 

* It's trivial that: *(follows a very non-trivial statement)*
* The proof is direct from Lemma 3.2 *(skipping the proof when the actual proof requires some works)*
* One can easily imagine the case: (*Where it's not easy to imagine at all*)
* The proof is in exercise 11.4 *(In an exercise that is based on previous 2 chapter of content and it's a follow up of another exercise)*
* Here, we skip the discussion[^1][^2][^3] and state that: *(some very non-trivial statement)*

To make gaslighting better, one can imagine adding extra unnecessary comments and add more details that actually sounds sincere: 
* The proof follows **trivially** from Lemma 4.5 and Theorem 17.8, we can simplify the second term into: *(skipping several steps there)*
* From line 2 of (5.4) it's **pretty much algebra**, and then we obtained the results: (*skipping 2 pages worth of algebra and 5 hours worth of patience and readers would have no choice but to believe it.*)
* Using some **basic calculus** we get: *(By calculus author means graduate text in analysis)*

When giving lectures, consider gaslighting the audiences. This is especially effective for confident undergraduates in honored degree, which reduces their arrogance significantly. 
* Using some basic **high school math**, we obtained: *(Proceed with manipulations on Cauchy Sums, nested infinite series, or a multinomial expansion)*
* I believe **everyone who sits here** has seen *(Some very obscure math on the blackboard)*
* For this part on, it's **basically grade school mathematics** that a 3 years old can carry out. *(Very complicated algebra, although elementary, but still complicated)*
* Oh, It's **just calculus**. *(Answering some specific questions from the student)*



[^1]: Non trivial sources.
[^2]: Where the heck is the paper.
[^3]: Some dead people's works and I can't find the corresponding lemma.
