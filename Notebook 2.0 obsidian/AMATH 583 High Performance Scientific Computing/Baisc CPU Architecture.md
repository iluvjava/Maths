Here is just a quick overview on some of the facts regarding CPU architectures and stuff. 


---
### **Intro**
We are interested in understanding the basics of `x86` architecture. 
 
---
### **Executions Cycles**:

1. Fetch
2. Decode 
3. Read 
4. Execute
5. Write

There are 5 steps, each take one clock cycle. 

We can't do sequential instruction at the same time but it's possible to fetch one struction, we decode first instruction while decode the first instruction.
