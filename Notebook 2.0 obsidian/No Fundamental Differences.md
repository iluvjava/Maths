There are not fundamental differences between the life of a mathematician and the life of a body builder. The body builder lift weights everyday, the mathematician lift math problems everyday. The body builder consume protein powder in the form of a drink, the mathematicians consume bean powder with bitter tastes in the form of a drink. The Body builder attains incredible muscle mass and muscle to fat ratio and post it on their social media with their pals, the mathematician attains incredible H-index and citation counts, which is displayed proudly on their web page, with their colleagues. 

At the end of the road. The body builder has massive muscles that is not entirely useful, nor comparable to the average person. The mathematician attains galaxy brain that is not even remotely comprehensible, nor comparable to that of an average person. The former become a professional gym coach, the later become a working professor or researcher.
