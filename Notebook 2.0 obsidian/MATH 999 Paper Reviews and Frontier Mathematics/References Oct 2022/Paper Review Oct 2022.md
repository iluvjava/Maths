### **Intro**

A list of major references. 

* [[FISTA_ A Fast Iterative Shrinka - Amir Beck.pdf]], by Marc Teboulle and Amir Beck. 
* [[Primer on Monotone Operators.pdf]], this one might be useful references as a remark for the convergence property of the method under non-smooth, nonconvex cases because it will experience a Fejer's Monotone convergence. 
* Standard Background Knowledge from my optimizations classes, most things will be proved in the appendix of the report anyway.

	abstract = { We consider the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms (ISTA) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude. },
