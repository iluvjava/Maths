### **Intro**

Kurdyka Lojasiewicz inequality helps with asserting the convergence of iterates for proximal point methods and its variant. 



**Reference**
We will use https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-011-0484-9, title "Convergence of descent methods for semi-algebraic and tame problems: proximal algorithms, forward–backward splitting, and regularized Gauss–Seidel methods" as the major source for discussion in this file.
