### **Intro**
Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). We state the assumptions of the algorithms and then summarized the algorithms. Including: 

1. The formulations of the Augmented Lagrangian
2. The assumptions made 
3. The optimality conditions 
4. Some brief justifications for some of the claims
