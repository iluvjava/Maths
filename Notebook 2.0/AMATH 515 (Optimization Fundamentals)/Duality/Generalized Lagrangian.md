The Lagrangian from calculus has been generalized for constrained, convex optimization problems. And they are the key to duality.

### **Intro**

From calculus we wish to solve $f(x)$ subjected to $g(x) = 0$ where $x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. 

**Claim 1**

> Lagrange Multiplier can be gotten by the process of dualization. 

See [[Duality (Example Transformation)]] for a demonstration in 2D, but here we derive it more generally. 
See [[Introducing The KKT Conditions]] for a 2-player interpretations of the matter.
