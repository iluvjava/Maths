Duality, the thing that keeps me awake. The thing that make mathematicians forget to sleep, to eat, and feed their child.

### **Intro**

This page glues everything about duality together, making it easier to search for stuff, and organize stuff. 

* Transforming the form of one problem into another, with their own variables. 
* And dual and primal variables are linked, linked differently depending on the problems. 
* Weak Duality Theory. 
* Strong Duality Theory. 

**Ingredients:** 
* Augmented Real Realm
* Convex Functions
* Fenchel Conjugate, Convex Conjugate, Legendre-Fenchel Transform. 
* An optimization problem. 

**Warnings:**

We are in the realm of $\bar{\mathbb{R}}$ and $\sup, \max$, $\min, \inf$ are used interchangably, which might anony some people.
