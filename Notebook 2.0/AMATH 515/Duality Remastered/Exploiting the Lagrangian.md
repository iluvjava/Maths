Lagrangian has information for the optimality conditions for the Dual and the Primal Problems.

### **Intro**

The Lagrangian appeared during the dualization process of the primal can be exploited. 

By connecting the primal and the dual via the Lagrangian, a newton based solver on the Lagrangian will be able to locate the optimality conditions, which is a saddle point of the Lagrangian.

### **Saddle Points of the Lagrangian**

> With strong duality, the saddle point of the Lagrangian is the optimal solution, and because of convexity of both convex feasible region and objective function, the saddle point will be unique. 

Keep in mind that the Lagrangian is the same from the calculus class, therefore using imagination, we can know that: 

* If the objective function is not convex, but the region is convex, then it's possible to have multiple critical points for the Lagrangian.
