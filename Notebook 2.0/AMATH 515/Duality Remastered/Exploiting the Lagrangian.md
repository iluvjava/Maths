Lagrangian has information for the optimality conditions for the Dual and the Primal Problems.

### **Intro**

The Lagrangian appeared during the dualization process of the primal can be exploited. 

By connecting the primal and the dual via the Lagrangian, a newton based solver on the Lagrangian will be able to locate the optimality conditions, which is a saddle point of the Lagrangian.
