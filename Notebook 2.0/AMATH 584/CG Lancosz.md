[[Lancosz Algoritm]], [[Conjugate Gradient]]


---
### **Intro**

Major ideas: 

> The residual vectors generated during the running of Conjugate Gradient has connection to the Orthogonal $q$ vectors from the Lancosz algorithm. 


#TODO: Show the connections between the Lancosz algorithm and the conjugate gradient algorithms.
