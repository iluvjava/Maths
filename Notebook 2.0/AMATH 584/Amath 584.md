### **Exact Numerics and Algorithms**
2. [[SVD]]: The basics, no algorithms
3. [[QR]]: The basics and Algorithms
4. [[LU Decomposition]]: The basics and algorithms

### **Eigendecomposition**
* [[Eigen Decompose]]: Basics
* [[Eigen Decomp Algo (Baisc and Intro)]]: Basics of Algorithmic approach of the matters. 
	* [[Eigen Decomp (The Pure QR)]]
	* [[Eigen Decomp Algo 3 (Shifted QR)]]
	* [[Hessenberg Transform intro (HS Reflector)]]
	* [[Eigen Decomp Algo 4 (Divided Conquer)]]
* And it's due to the research in Eigendecomposition, we now have efficient algorithms for SVD.

### **Advanced Topics**
* [[Schur Decomposition]]: Basics for the theory of Eigenvalue Decomposition. 
* [[Krylov Subspace]]: Basics and why it's relevant to iterative methods for matrix inverse. 
* [[Hessenberg Transform intro (HS Reflector)]]: Similar to Schur Decomposition, but it's conceived for numerical algorithms. 
	* [[Hessenberg Transform with Arnoldi Iterations]]
