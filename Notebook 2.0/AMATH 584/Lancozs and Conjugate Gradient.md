[[Conjugate Gradient]], [[Lancosz Algoritm]]

---
### **Intro**

There are a lot of ways to derive the conjugate Gradient algorithm. 

In [[Conjugate Gradient]] we derived the algorithm using the Gramschitz conjugation, here we will minimize the energy norm of the residual vector over the Krylov Subspace. 

Make you you know the Lancosz algorithm and its relations with Krylov Subspace.
