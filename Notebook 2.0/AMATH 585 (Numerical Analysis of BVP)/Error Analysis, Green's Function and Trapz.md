[[Steady State BVP Error Analysis 2]]


---
### **Intro**

We continue the discussion about the error of the Finite difference scheme using the Green's function. 

We perform backwards error analysis of the problem, and show what is the perturbed problem that solution of the finite difference is solving with exact precision.
