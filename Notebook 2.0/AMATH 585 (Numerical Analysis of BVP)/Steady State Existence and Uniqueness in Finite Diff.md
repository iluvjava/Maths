Prereq: [[Finite Difference]], [[Direct Method]]


---
### **Intro**

We are interested in how the existence and uniqueness of some type of problems are manifested in solving equations using the Finite Difference Method. Here, we will be using an example involving the steady state 1D Non-Homogenous Heat equation with Neuamn Boundary Conditions.
