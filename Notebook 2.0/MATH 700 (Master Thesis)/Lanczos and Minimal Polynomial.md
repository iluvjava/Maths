[[Lanczos Iteration]]

### **Theorem Statement**

> The characteric polynomial of $T_k$ generated by Lanczos iterations minimizes the 2 norm among all polynomials under a weight subspace at the eigenvalues of $A$



### **Proof**

We make use of [[Arnoldi minimal Monic Polynomial]], let $\overline{p}_k(x)$ be the characteristic polynomial of $T_k$ and, use $\mathcal P_k$ denotes all the monic polynomial of degree $k$, then: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \overline{p}(A)q_1 &= \min_{p\in \mathcal P_k}\Vert p(A)q_1\Vert_2
    \\
    &= \min_{p\in \mathcal P_k}\Vert Up(\Lambda) U^Hq_1\Vert_2
    \\
    &= \min_{p\in \mathcal P_k}
    \Vert p(\Lambda)U^Hq_1\Vert_2
    \\
    &= \min_{p\in \mathcal P_k}
        \sum_{i = 1}^{n}
            p(\lambda_i)(U^Hq_1)_i
\end{aligned}
$$

From the first line to the second line, we use the fact that $A$ is symmetric so that it admits $A = U\Lambda ^H$ as an eigen decomposition for it. From the third line to the 4th line is because $U$ is unitary. From the last line, we know that $\overline{p}_k(A)q_1$ is minimizing the weighted sum at all $\lambda_i$ where the weight is given by $(U^Hq_1)_i$.

### **Consequences**

The Lanczos iterations when computed exactly is going to converge the same number of time as the totaly number of unique $\lambda_i$ when $(U^Hq_1)_i \neq 0$.
