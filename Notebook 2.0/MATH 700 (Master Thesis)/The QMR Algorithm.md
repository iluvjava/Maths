[[Bi Conjugate Gradient]], [[Bi-Lanczos]]

### **Intro**

Here we are intersted in QMR algorithm. Which will give us a better implementation for the BiCG. The QMR Algorithm is MINRes inspired via Bi-Lanczos Factorization of Non-Symmetric Matrices. 

Both MINres and QMR uses the plane rotations matrices, and GMRes too, but GMRes is based on Arnoldi iterations and one one side krylov subspace, and orthogonal reduction, while BiCG is based on Bi-Orthogonal spaces and Oblique Projection.
