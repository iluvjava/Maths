### **Intro**

There is a relations between the orthogonal polynomials representing the lanczos vector $q_k$ in the krylov subspace, and the characteristic polynomial of $T_k$ during that iterations. Let $p_k(x)$ denotes the characteristic polynomial for $T_k$ generated by the Iterative Lanczos algorithm, and let $\psi_k$ denotes the $k - 1$ degree polynomial of $q_k$ represented under Krylov Subspace, then:

> $$
> \begin{aligned}
>     \psi_k(x) = \left(\prod_{i = 1}^{k-1} \beta_i\right)^{-1}(-1)^{k - 1}p_{k - 1}(x)
> \end{aligned}
> $$

As a corollary of the theorem, the characteristic polynomial of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix generated by the Lanczos iteration is also orthogonal over the same weighted discrete measure that $\psi_j$ is in.

### **Proof**
Suppose that the recursion for the cahracterstic polynomial for $T_k$ is true, and inductively we assume that formulas: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \psi_j(x) &= \left(\prod_{i = 1}^{j-1} \beta_i\right)^{-1}
    (-1)^{j - 1}p_{j - 1}(x)
    \quad \forall\; 1 \le j \le k
    \\
    \beta_j \psi_{j + 1} &= 
    (x - \alpha_j)\psi_j - \beta_{j - 1}\psi_{j -1}
    \\
    p_k(x) &= (\alpha_k - x)p_{k - 1}(x) - \beta_{k - 1}^2p_{k - 1}(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

Assume the recursion for th characterstic polynomial and the orthogonal polynomials are true, we inductively prove that it holds up for $j = k + 1$.
