[[Infinite Probability Spaces]]
An example we are going to try for Infinite Probability spaces, and probability measure. 

---
### **Intro**

Here, we will try to go from discrete probability spaces of finite many coin tosses, to an infinite probability spaces and demonstrate the construction of $\sigma$-alg and probability measure on the infinite probability spaces.
