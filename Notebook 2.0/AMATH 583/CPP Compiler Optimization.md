[[CPP MultiStage Compilation]]
Here, we will be talking about compiler Optimization. This is a flag that people can use to improve the performance of the code. The clang compiler is able to use architectural advantage to speed up the execution of the code.

### **Intro**

There are 3 flags for this: 

```bash
c++ target.cpp -g O1
c++ target.cpp -g O2
c++ target.cpp -g O3
c++ target.cpp -g Ofast
```
