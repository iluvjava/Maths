Let's get to the basic of c++.

### **Intro**

FLOPS: Floating points operations per seconds

Note: Don't divides the same number multiple times in float, that cost several clock cycles, if there is need for that, consider multiplying by the reciprocal of that floats.

Sometimes the floating points is computed via the number of double precision floating operations. 

Sometimes the floating point is computed via the number of single precision computations.
