[[Fields of Values]]
We are interested in computing the fields of values. 

---
### **Intro**

The fields of values is a compact, convex set. The proofs for that part is still *unclear*. 

Take the for granted, then we only need to sample from the boundary, and then create a convex hull around all the sampled points to approximate the set of numerical values of a given matrix.
