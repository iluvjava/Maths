[[Matrices]], [[Spectral Radius]]

---
### **Intro**

The idea of fields of values is analogous to spectral radius, but it's for non-hermitian matrices. 

Definition 

$$
\mathcal{F}(A) = \left\lbrace
    \frac{y^HAy}{y^Hy}: y \in \mathbb{C}^n
\right\rbrace
$$

This is a set of scalars. The thing inside is called the Rayleigh Quotient.
