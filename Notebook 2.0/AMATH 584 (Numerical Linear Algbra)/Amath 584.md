### **Exact Numeric and Algorithms**
2. [[SVD]]: The basics, no algorithms
3. [[QR]]: The basics and Algorithms
4. [[LU Decomposition]]: The basics and algorithms

### **Eigen Decomposition**
* [[Eigen Decompose]]: Basics
* [[Inverse Power Iteration]]: Basics of Algorithmic approach of the matters. 
	* [[Eigen Decomp (The Pure QR)]]
	* [[Eigen Decomp Algo 3 (Shifted QR)]]
	* [[Hessenberg Transform intro (HS Reflector)]]
	* [[Secular Equation and Cuppen's Method]]
* And it's due to the research in Eigen Decomposition, we now have efficient algorithms for SVD.

### **Advanced Topics**
* [[Schur Decomposition]]: Basics for the theory of Eigenvalue Decomposition. 
* [[Krylov Subspace]]: Basics and why it's relevant to iterative methods for matrix inverse. 
* [[Hessenberg Transform intro (HS Reflector)]]: Similar to Schur Decomposition, but it's conceived for numerical algorithms. 
	* [[Hessenberg Transform with Arnoldi Iterations]]
* [[Conjugate Gradient with Krylov Subspace]]: An Krylov Subspace Iterative Approximation method, under energy norm of a Positive Definite Hermitian matrix. It's just called Conjugate Gradient because of the A-Orthogoal vectors that are used for approximation.
