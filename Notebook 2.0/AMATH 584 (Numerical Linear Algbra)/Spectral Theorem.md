[[Schur Decomposition]]

We make use of the Schur Decomposition to proof spectral theorem before.

### **Intro**

The proof of spectral theorem applies well to Hermitian matrix, but it also applies on Normal Matrices. 

Here, we will look at another proof of the spectral theorem. Which is phrased in a much larger and general scope, and uses totally different ideas. 

A list of things that we are going to use for the spectral theorem's proof: 

* [[Lagrangian and Dualization Techniques]]
* [[Hermitian Adjoint]]

We are going to perform optimization on an invariant subspace of the Adjoint Operator.

### **Lemma 1**

Given any invariant subspace of adjoint operator $A$, then the orthogonal subspace is an invariant subspace as well.
