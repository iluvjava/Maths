The Frobenius Method is related to solving some vary complected second order ODEs. 

And it's used to look for the solution of the Bessel's equation, [[Bessel's Equation]]

But in the discussion of the Bessel's equation, there is a lack of clarification and formal treatment of the method, and this is what this file is about. We are going to give a more detailed view of the Frobenius method under a much general context for solving Second Order ODEs.
