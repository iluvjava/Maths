This is the missing piece.
It's in the chapter 12 of the textbook.

### **Intro**

The problem we dealt with, like the eigenvalue, eigen-functions for the 1D heat, wave equation, and the bessel's equation, and the Legendre equations, they are all made from the same factory. 

And that factory is Sturm Liouville System. Which will be referred to as the SL system for short.

The coolest part is that, we also have an orthogonality theorem that comes with the Sturm Liouville Systems.
