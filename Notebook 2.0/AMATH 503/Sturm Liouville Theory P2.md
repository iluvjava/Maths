### **Recap**

One of the properties is that, all the EigenValues for the SL system is positive. However, $\lambda$ is allowed to be equals to zero, if $y'(x) = 0$ and $q(x) = 0$. 

And this is exactly the case for the Fourier System with the Neumann Boundary Conditions. 

And the corresponding eigen function is a constant. In that case, I think the constant function falls into the null space of the ODE somehow.

### **Eigen Values are Discrete and Forms an Increasing Sequence**

It means: 

$$
\lambda_1 \le \lambda_2 \le \cdots 
$$

and 

$$
\lim_{i\rightarrow \infty} \lambda_i = \infty
$$

Provided that $p(x) > 0$ and $r(x) > 0$ in $(a, b)$. 

And the difference between the Eigenvalues are the same.
