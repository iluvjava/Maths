### **Intro**

Conservation: 

$$
u_t + q_x = 0
$$

Where $u$ represent the concentration, and $q$ represent the flux. The subscript represents the partial derivative. For higher dimension, replace $q_x$ with the divergence of the function $q$. 

if $q$ is a function wrt to $u$ only, then we have: 

$$
\frac{\partial q}{\partial u} = a(u)\quad u_t + a(u)u_x = 0
$$

if $q$ is a function of $u_x$, then we can have: 

$$
q = -ku_x
$$

Where $k$ is given as a constant. This is the heat equation, or the diffusion equation.
