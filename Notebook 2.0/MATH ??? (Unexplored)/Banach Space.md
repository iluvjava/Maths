[[Vector Space]]

### **Banach Space**

[Banach space](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BanachSpace.html) is a complete vector space. It's an set of elements that can form a Complete vector space with a norm calculations.  **Note**: The "complete" in this contex is referring to closure under Cauchy Sequence, not interpreated as "complete with".


**Banach But not Hilbert**
> It's implied from the definition, that, there exists instances of Banach Space that is not Hilbert Space. Such a space would have norm that is not defined via inner product.
