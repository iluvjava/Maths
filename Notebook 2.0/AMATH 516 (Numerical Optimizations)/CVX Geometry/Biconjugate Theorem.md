[[Convex Conjugation]]

---
### **Intro**

Convex conjugate represents the epigraph of a function via affine minorants, or basically half spaces. 

**Theorem Statement**

> For any proper function we have the convex closure of the epigraph of a function is the same as the epigraph of the biconjugation of that function: 
> $$
> \text{epi}(f^{\star\star}) = \text{cl}\circ \text{cvxh}\circ \text{epi}(f)
> $$
