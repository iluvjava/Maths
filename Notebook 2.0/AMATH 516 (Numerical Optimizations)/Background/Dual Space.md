[[Euclidean Space]]
[[Dual Norm]]

---
### **Intro**

Denote $\mathbb E$ to be the original space, then the dual space of it is $\mathbb E^\star$, which is exactly the same as the original space $\mathbb E$, but it's using the dual norm: $\Vert\cdot \Vert_\star$. (Definition taken from \<Fist Order method in optimizations\>).
