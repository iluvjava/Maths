### **Existence of a minimizer**

The existence of a minimizer depends on the continuity and the compactness of the set. And to do that we need to define a few things first. 

**Theorem: Closed Epigraph**

> The epigraph of a function is closed iff the function is lower-semi-continuous. 

**Proof**: Not Yet Given

**Coercive Function**

Definition: 
> Function $f:\mathbf{E}\mapsto \mathbb{\bar{R}}$ is coercive if for any sequence $x_i$ with $\Vert x\Vert_i\rightarrow \infty$ it must be that $f(x_i)\rightarrow + \infty$.

### **Theorem**
**Existence of a Minimizer**

> If a function is lower-semi-continuous and Coercive, then it must have minimizers.
