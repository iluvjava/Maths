[[Finite Euclidean Inner Product]]

---
### **Def**: 

Finite dimentional vector spaces with an inner product defined over it. Just anything that is exiomatically equivant to $\mathbb{R}^n$, but $n$ could really be natural number. It's usually denoted by $\mathbb E$. The space would be introduced with the following things: 

* [[Vector Space]]
* [[Innert Product Space]]
