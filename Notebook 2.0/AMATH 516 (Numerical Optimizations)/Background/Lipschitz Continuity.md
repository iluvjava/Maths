### **Intro**

Lipschitz Continuity is a type of continuity for function. Let's consider the Euclidean space to be the metric space and we consider functions of the type: $f(x):\mathbb{R}^m\mapsto \mathbb{R}^n$. Then, the function is Lipschitz if: 

> $$
> \exists L\in \mathbb{R}: \Vert f(x) - f(y)\Vert \le L \Vert x - y\Vert
> $$

Sometimes,the function has Lipschitz Continuity over a closed domain, in that case the function is referred to as Locally Lipschitz. 

Take notes that, all lipschitz continuous functions are also Uniformally Continous. This is direct from the definition above. Proof Skipped.

### **Beta-Smoothness**

A function is beta smooth if its derivative is Lipschitz Continuous.  See [[Beta Smoothness]] for more information.
