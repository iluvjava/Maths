### **Intro**

Lipschitz gradient characterize change of the objective value of the functions with the norm for the gradient, and smoothness of a function, which is important for the convergence behaviors of fixed gradient method. One of the major source for this file will be coming from the UCLA class lecture slides, linked [here](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/236C/lectures/gradient.pdf#page14). The references of this slide will also be acknowledged and cited. There is another paper talking about the Lipchitz Gradient and it's relations to strong convexity: [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06573). 

**Theorem Statement**: 

Let $f: \mathbb E \mapsto \mathbb{\bar R}$, and it has a gradient that Lipschitz continuous with constant $L$ which is:
