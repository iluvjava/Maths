In this file we provide proof the theorem listed in: [[Convex Functions Characteristics#Continuity of Closed Convex Functions]]. To prove it, we need to introduce a lemma first.

### **1D Convex Lipschitz Lemma**

> Given a function $f: \mathbb R \mapsto \bar {\mathbb R}$ that is proper and proper, then the function is lipschitz continuuous for every $[x_1, x_2] \subset \text{int}\circ\text{dom}(f)$. 

**Proof Preparations**

1. It's not possible to get vertical tagent line at the interior of the domain of $f$.
2. The intersection of the tagent line and $f(x_1), f(x_2)$ has a minimum among them, and that is the lower bound for $f(x)$ over $[x_1, x_2]$
3. The upper bound has candidate $f(x_1), f(x_2)$ over the entire $[x_1, x_2]$
4. Due to the compact nature of $[x_1, x_2]$, and the boundedness of $f(x)$ over it, it's Lipschitz continuous.
