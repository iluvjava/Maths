### **Intro**

Subderivative is a number, not a vector. It tells how the function changes given a specific direction and a point in the domain of the function. The idea of a subderivatives is complicated. Here, we present an overview of its definitions and variants taken from several different sources: 

* Dimitry's AMATH 516 Course Notes. 
  * Section 3.5.2, page 68. 
* \<Variational Analysis by Rockafellar\>
  * 8.A, Page: 299. 
* \<Modern Nonconvex Nondifferentialble Optimizations\> by Ying Cui
  * This book has a very detailed classifications of different types of subderivatives. 
  * 4.1, page 150. 
* \<First Order Methods in Optimizations\>
  * Section 3.3 starts talking about directional derivatives. pg: 44
