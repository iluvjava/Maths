### **Intro**

A multifunction is a special time of relations. Let $F(x)$ be a multifunction, we denote $R$ to be a relations then: 

$$
F(x) = y \iff (x, y)\in R
$$

$F$ is an operator that maps $\mathbb E$ to $\mathbb E$, back to itself, denoted as $F: \mathbb E\rightrightarrows\mathbb E$. Here is a list of concepts for the operators we defined consequently: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{dom}(F) := \{x: \exists y: (x, y)\in R\}
    \\
    & \text{ran}(F) := \{y: (x, y)\in R\}
    \\
    & \text{gph}(F) := \{(x, y): (x, y) \in R\}
\end{aligned}
$$

The graph of the operator is literally the multi-function visualized on a higher dimensions of the cross product space.
