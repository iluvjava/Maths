[[Subgradient and Subdifferential Definition]]


---
**Intro**

We explore some of the properties with the multi-value functions that is the subgradient. And we will list the results here: 

* [[Bounded Subgradient Lemma]]
* [[Nonempty Subdifferential Implies Convexity]]
* [[Subgradient and Level Sets]]
