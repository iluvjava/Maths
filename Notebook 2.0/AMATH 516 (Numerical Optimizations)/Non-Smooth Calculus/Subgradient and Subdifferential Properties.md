[[Subgradient and Subdifferential Definition]]


---
**Intro**

We explore some of the properties with the multi-value functions that is the subgradient. And we will list the results here: 

* [[Bounded Subgradient Lemma]]
* [[Nonempty Subdifferential Implies Convexity]]
* [[Subgradient and Level Sets]]

Other Properties that I gather but doesn't have the time to prove them yet: 
* The graph of the subgradient for a closed convex function $f$ is also a closed set, meaning that the set $\{(x, v)\in \mathbb E \times \mathbb E: v \in \partial [f](v)\}$ is a closed set.
