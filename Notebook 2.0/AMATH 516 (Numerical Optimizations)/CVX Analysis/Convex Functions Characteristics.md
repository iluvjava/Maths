### **Lower Semi-Continuous Convex function is Closed**

> A convex function $f$ is closed if an only if it's lower semi-continous. 

**Proof**: 

The direciton where, if a function is lower semi-continuous and it's convex, then its epigraph is closed. This is direct and proved in [[Lower Semi-Continuity is Closedness of Epigraph]]. The other direction is also obvious because if a function is closed, regardless of it being convex or not, it's l.s.c.

### **Continuity of Closed Convex Functions**

> Let $f: \mathbb E \mapsto \mathbb{\bar R}$ be convex. Let $x_0 \in \text{int}(\text{dom}(f))$, then there exists $\epsilon > 0$, and $L > 0$ such that $\mathbb B_{x_0}(\epsilon)\subseteq C$.

**Proof:**

#TODO: Proof is one of the main results from Dimitry's notes, chapter 3


**Remarks**:

### **Continuity of Convex Unitvariate Functions**

**Proof** The proof needs the above statement.
