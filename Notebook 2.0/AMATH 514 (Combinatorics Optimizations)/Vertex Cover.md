### **Intro**

> A vertex cover of a graph is a subset of vertices such that all edges on the graph contains some vertices from the vertex cover. 

Let $G:=(V, E)$ Let $W$ be an vertex cover then: 

$$
\forall e \in E: e\cap W\neq \emptyset
$$

If $W$ is an vertex cover then any set containing this set is automatically a vertex cover. For this we are interested in the minimum vertex cover, denoted by: $\tau(G)$; the cardinality of the minimum vertex cover set.
