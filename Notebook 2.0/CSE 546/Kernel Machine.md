Here we will be highlighting some of the inner structure of kenel machines and the idea behind it. 

Here are some other things in the vault that uses the idea of kernel. 
[[Kernel PCA]], [[SVM]], [[SVM and Kernels]]

### **Intro**

Kernels provides a fast way of computing high dimensional features. 

Kernels provides a way to compute implicit features mapping, like the case with the radial Gaussian Basis for SVMs.
