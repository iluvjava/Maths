Before training Neuro net, make sure to have some basic understanding on the back prop algorithm involved with the training: 
[[Back Propagation]], [[Back Propagation 2]]

This file is going to be a practical guide on training the Neural network using pytorch in python.

### **Intro**

There are a lot of machine learning libraries, but here we will be focusing on pytorch. 

Notice that, all of these machine learning libraries are not that different from each other, in a sense that, the all have the following APIs: 


* Auto Diff
* GPU supports 

And that is all people need for training Neural Net. 

It's just a buffed up mathematical computational libraries.

### **Common Useful Functions**

Suppose: 

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
```

is executed, so we have the correct namespace.
