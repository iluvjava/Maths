This concept has already been introduced in the AMATH class. 

In [[Basic Machine Learning]]. 

And this is a similar idea compare to

### **Intro**


The Gaussian Distribution in $n$ dimension can be: 

$$
P(x; \mu, \Sigma) - 
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{d/2}|\Sigma|^{1/2}}
\exp \left(
    - \frac{1}{2}(x - \mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x - \mu)
\right) 
$$

This is a Gaussian Distribution with a linear transform matrix $\Sigma$, and a center $\mu$.
