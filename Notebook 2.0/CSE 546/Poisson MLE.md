We are going to derive the MLE for the poisson distribution
[[Maximal Likelihood Estimator]]

We also discussed the generalized linear model for poisson distribution in [[Generalized Linear Model]], as an example, and putting it into an optimization problem in the optimization class.

### **Intro**

The model is given by: 

$$
\text{Poi}(x|\lambda) = \exp(-\lambda) \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}
$$
