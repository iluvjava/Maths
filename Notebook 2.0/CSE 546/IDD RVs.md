Here we will catch up on the idea of IDD RVs, Independently and identically distributed random variables.


---
### **Intro**

The covariance of the iid rvs are going to be zero. 

$$
\text{Cov}\left[
        X, Y
    \right] = 0
$$
The joint probability densitys function of the 2 variable is: 

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(X = x \cap Y = y\right) = 
f_{X, Y}(x, y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)
$$
