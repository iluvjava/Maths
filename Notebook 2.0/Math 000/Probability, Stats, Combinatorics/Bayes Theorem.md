Bayes Theorem


---

### **Intro**

It's used everywhere and it's connecting related to conditional probability. 

Here is the statement of the theorem: 

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(A|B\right)
=
\frac{\mathbb{P}\left(B|A\right)
    \mathbb{P}\left(A\right)
}{\mathbb{P}\left(B\right)}
$$

Let's say A means: 
1. Someone has a rare disease. 

Let's say that B means: 
1. He got tested to have that rare disease. 

Then, let's see what this formula is trying to do: 

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(A|B\right)
$$

Probability of having that rare disease given that he got tested positive on that disease. 

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(A|B\right)
$$

Given that someone has a rare disease, the probability of he got tested to have that disease. This quantity depends on the accuracy of the test.  

$$
\frac{\mathbb{P}\left(B|A\right)
    \mathbb{P}\left(A\right)
}{\mathbb{P}\left(B\right)}
$$

People who actually have that disease and they actually got tested positive on that disease divides the totally number of people who have that rare disease.
