### **Intro**

Consider statements: 

> Given $n$ distinguishable objects, we want to put them into $k$ bins. How many are ways are there to put it? 

> I have $k$ integers and I want to add them up to $n$, how many ways are there to add to that? 

They are exactly the same thing.

### **Stars and Bars Statement**

Define $n$ and $k$ as the same quantities in the statement of the problem above.
