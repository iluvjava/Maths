### **Vector Space**

A vector space is a set $V$ that are of what we call vectors, and **a scalar field** $F$. There are a list of axioms to satisfy for the choice of $F, V$. Let $x,y,z$ and $r, s$ be any members of the set $V, F$, define a multiplications between vectors and scalar, addition between vector and vector, then the following must be true: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & x + y = y + x
    \\
    & (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)
    \\
    & \mathbf 0 + x = x + \mathbf 0 = x
    \\
    & \exists (-x): x + (-x) = \mathbf 0
    \\
    & (r)(sx) = (rs)x
    \\
    & (r + s)x = rx + sx
    \\
    & r(x + y) = rx + ry
    \\
    & 1(x) = x
\end{aligned}
$$

Where, the set $V$ contains the additive identity $\mathbf 0$.

### **Subtleties**

**Complete And Incomplete**: 

> The set of vector spapces can be complete if all cauchy sequence converges to a given element in the set, else the set is incomplete. 

**Finite Fields**:

> Take note that the set $F$ is a scalar field, and it can be a finite field too. 

**Lacks of Inner Product**:
> The definition above lacks the definition of an inner product for the vectors.
