### **Intro**

Linear programming in brief is just optimizing on a polytopes/polyhedra along a vector. Nothing fancy. 

**Definition of Linear Programming**

> A LP problem is maximizing/minimizing the quantity $\langle c, x\rangle$ where $x\in P$ where $P$ is a polyhedra. 

**A Fundamental Result**: 

> If the polyhedra is bounded along direction $c$, then the maximum of the LP objective value is attained at some point that is inside of the polyhedra. Cite as Lemma 2.1 from \<A Course in Combinatorics Optimizations\>
