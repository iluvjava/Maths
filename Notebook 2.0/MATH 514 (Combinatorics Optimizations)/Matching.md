### **Intro**

> A matching of a graph is a set of edges such that all edges in the set is incident to uniquely 2 edges on the original graph. 


Let $M$ be a matching for the graph $G:=(V, E)$, then: 

$$
e, e' \in M \wedge e \neq e' \implies 
e \cap e' = \emptyset
$$

Any subset of a matching is still a matching, therefore we are interested in maximum matching of a graph, commonly denoted by $\nu(G)$; the cardinality of the maximum matching set.
