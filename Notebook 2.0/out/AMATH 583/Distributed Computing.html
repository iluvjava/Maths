        <p>A bunch of computers working together to do computation.</p>
<p>We are going to ues different processes for parallelism. Unlike threads, they are not going to share the same memory space.</p>

<h3 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h3>
<p>This is about distributed memory computation.</p>
<p>The problem is, we can't just keep all the data for each of the computing node, all of them, the same.</p>
<p>Computing Node: The CPU</p>
<p>Now, we would need to share the memory across different nodes in this case.</p>

<p>Single Program Multiple Data.</p>
<p>There is a single program, the program data is the same.</p>
<p>Each node has the same program that is executing.</p>
<p>But for each node the data is not the same.</p>

<p>Communicating Sequential Process: CSP</p>
<p>Characterize the computation as having separate processes, and they have disjoint data that they have to access, and the data is communicated.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="separate-process"><strong>Separate Process</strong></h3>
<p>In the case of parallel processing, we make use of threads for parallel computing.</p>
<p>Now, we will be using different processes, multiple instances of <code>main()</code> will be invoked for each instance of the program.</p>
<p>And ultimately these processes are going to communicate.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the values to each of the proccess.</li>
<li>Everyone does the job</li>
<li>If current process is having ID 0, then it collects the results from every other processes and then submit it.</li>
</ol>
