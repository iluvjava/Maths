### Definition 

A Metamorphic function satisfies the following features: 

* It's single valued, and their only singularities are "**Isolated Poles**". 
* It can be expressed as the ratios of 2 ENTIRE functions. 

Note: That, it has to be a isolated pole, which means that, for Essential Singularity, they are automatically not a Meromorphic function.
