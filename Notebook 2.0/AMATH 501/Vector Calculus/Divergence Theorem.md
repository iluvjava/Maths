So in this file we are going to discuss the basics about divergence theorem. 

prereq: [[Volume Integrals]], [[Surfaces]], [[Div]]

--- 

#### Preconditions

Given a vector field in any dimension, and the field is smooth, meaning that it's continuous and the derivative of it is also continuous over the region of volume then the divergence theorem can be applied: 

> $$
> \underset{V}{\iiint} \nabla\cdot \vec{F} dV = \underset{\text{Boundary}(V)}{\iint} \vec{F}\cdot\; d\vec{S}
> $$

This is say that, the sum of all the divergence over a volume in space is the same as the sum of all the divergence around the boundary of the volume. 

And, in the case of Curvilinear Integration, we will need some of the volume integral stuff [[Volume Integrals]], and we will also need some surface integral to handle it: [[Surfaces]]. 


**Note**: The Stoke's Theorem and the Divergence theorem is similar because: 

They both have a surface integral. 
They are different because: 
Stoke's theorem can only be used for 3d, any 2d where it's actually viewing things on subspace in 3d.
