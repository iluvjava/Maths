A div of a vector field is the a scalar field where it measures the amount of divergence of particlels of each points, if there are particles moving along the arrows of the vector field.

**The Definition of Divergence of a vector field**

Vector field is a mapping such that: Fector field ---> Scalar field. 

For a given function that $\mathbb{R}^{n} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{n}$, 

And the function is like: 
$$F(x, y, z) = \begin{bmatrix} 
	F_1(x, y, z)\\[0.5em]
	F_2(x, y, z)\\[0.5em]
	F_3(x, y, z)
\end{bmatrix}$$

> $$\nabla\cdot(F) = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x}$$

Netflow in equals to netflow out means that $\nabla\cdot F = 0$, and if this is applied fluid flow, then this is like incompressible fluids!

#### Divergence of Scalar Multiplied Vector Field

So here we are interested in looking for the divergence of a field, a vector function, multiplied by a scalar function. 

Here, $\Phi$ is the scalar function and $F$ is the vector function.

> \nabla \cdot (\Phi F) = \Phi (\nabla \cdot F) + (\nabla \Phi)\cdot F
