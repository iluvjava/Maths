### **Intro**

I wish to quantify the ability in mathematics, using an expanding sequences of set of abilities, each one includes all previous one with additional abilities and knowledge sets

---
### **Level 1**
1. The ability to do arithemetic.
2. The ability to do nontrivial algebra.
3. The ability to read undergraduate textbooks.
4. The ability to realize a problem is a math problems. 


---
### **Level 2**
1. Ability to do calculus. 
2. Ability to manipulate nontrivial algebra such a summations, products, vector calculus and matrices
3. The ability to understand the topics in undergraduate textbooks, state their significant and reproduce proofs that are intuitive, and graph things that provokes understandings. 
4. The ability to do research for math on the internet. 
5. The ability to realize components of a real world problems and analyze them, generting solutions related to mathematics using those attributes of the problem. 

---
### **level 3**
1. Ability to understand non trivial proofs of a subjects, good at first order logics, understand the components and structures of mathematical statements and argument and the substleties that are involved.
2. Ability to manipulate pages of non-trivial algebra, calculus, matrices, and various others type of mathematics that are more abstract, such as proofs.
3. Ability to read graduate textbooks, state the topics of research, the difficulties and challenges in certain subjects, and understand them if it's in the specified realms of expertise. 
4. The ability to do research with professors and peers, using the internet, communicating with other professions and field experts to produce understanding on the topic of their expertise.
5. The ability to recognize inefficiency of modern solutions given to classes of mathematical problems, suggest potential improvements, OR, research directions that can improve the solutions. Recognize significant results from other people's research, somewhat understand their inspirations behind. 
6. The ability to ask insightful questions in such a way that it can point to breakthrough. 
7. The ability to spot deep connections between ideas. 
8. The ability to see through symbolic expressions in multiple forms and directly understand the mathematical entities behind, and the interactions behind upon reading about them, and then reason based on intutions, use intution to feed back to the formalism of mathematics.
9. The ability to explore and learn math faster than all previous level. 


### **Level 4 and Beyond**

I cannot comprehen or, I haven't spotted it in others around me, giving me the ability to quantify them, OR, in the final case, the abilites that I am unable to comprehend even upon observing their some of works, life stories in details. Such is the case for most works done by famous mathematicians such as Gauss, Euler, Ramanujan, and Riemann. However, for the last case, it's up to debate whether it's a lack of knowledge, or abilities in mathematics for me as an observer, or the case that even if I have the knowledge I would still not able to understand and quantify their abilities.
