	abstract = {A large number of imaging problems reduce to the optimization of a cost function , with typical structural properties. The aim of this paper is to describe the state of the art in continuous optimization methods for such problems, and present the most successful approaches and their interconnections. We place particular emphasis on optimal first-order schemes that can deal with typical non-smooth and large-scale objective functions used in imaging problems. We illustrate and compare the different algorithms using classical non-smooth problems in imaging, such as denoising and deblurring. Moreover, we present applications of the algorithms to more advanced problems, such as magnetic resonance imaging, multilabel image segmentation, optical flow estimation, stereo matching, and classification.},

	url = {https://hal.science/hal-00490826},
	abstract = {We study a first-order primal-dual algorithm for convex optimization problems with known saddle-point structure. We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions, which is optimal for the complete class of non-smooth problems we are considering in this paper. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield optimal rates on easier problems. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N²) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O(1/e{\textasciicircum}N) on problems where both are uniformly convex. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and image segmentation.},

	abstract = {Total variation (TV) and non-local self-similarity (NSS) are powerful tools for successfully enhancing compressive sensing performance. However, standard TV approaches often over-smooth detailed edges in the image, due to the uniform regularization of gradient magnitude. In this paper, a novel compressed sensing method for the reconstruction of medical images is proposed, the image edges are well preserved with the proposed reweighted TV. The redundancy of the NSS patch also is leveraged through the sparse regression model. The proposed model was solved with an efficient strategy of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Experimental results on thesimulated phantom, brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compressed sensing approaches.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel method for resolution enhancement for volumetric images based on a variational-based reconstruction approach. The reconstruction problem is posed using a deconvolution model that seeks to minimize the total variation norm of the image. Additionally, we propose a new edge-preserving operator that emphasizes and even enhances edges during the up-sampling and decimation of the image. The edge enhanced reconstruction is shown to yield significant improvement in resolution, especially preserving important edges containing anatomical information. This method is demonstrated as an enhancement tool for low-resolution, anisotropic, 3D brain MRI images, as well as a pre-processing step to improve skull-stripping segmentation of brain images.},
