	abstract = {We consider a combined restarting and adaptive backtracking strategy for the popular Fast Iterative Shrinking-Thresholding Algorithm frequently employed for accelerating the convergence speed of large-scale structured convex optimization problems. Several variants of FISTA enjoy a provable linear convergence rate for the function values \$F(x\_n)\$ of the form \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}( e{\textasciicircum}\{-K{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mu/L\}{\textasciitilde}n\})\$ under the prior knowledge of problem conditioning, i.e. of the ratio between the ({\textbackslash}L ojasiewicz) parameter \${\textbackslash}mu\$ determining the growth of the objective function and the Lipschitz constant \$L\$ of its smooth component. These parameters are nonetheless hard to estimate in many practical cases. Recent works address the problem by estimating either parameter via suitable adaptive strategies. In our work both parameters can be estimated at the same time by means of an algorithmic restarting scheme where, at each restart, a non-monotone estimation of \$L\$ is performed. For this scheme, theoretical convergence results are proved, showing that a \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}( e{\textasciicircum}\{-K{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}mu/L\}n\})\$ convergence speed can still be achieved along with quantitative estimates of the conditioning. The resulting Free-FISTA algorithm is therefore parameter-free. Several numerical results are reported to confirm the practical interest of its use in many exemplar problems.},

In this paper, we derive linear convergence rates of several first order methods for solving smooth non-strongly convex constrained optimization problems, i.e. involving an objective function with a Lipschitz continuous gradient that satisfies some relaxed strong convexity condition. In particular, in the case of smooth constrained convex optimization, we provide several relaxations of the strong convexity conditions and prove that they are sufficient for getting linear convergence for several first order methods such as projected gradient, fast gradient and feasible descent methods. We also provide examples of functional classes that satisfy our proposed relaxations of strong convexity conditions. Finally, we show that the proposed relaxed strong convexity conditions cover important applications ranging from solving linear systems, Linear Programming, and dual formulations of linearly constrained convex problems.},

In this work, we use the PPM method to provide conceptually simple derivations along with convergence analyses of different versions of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (AGM). The key observation is that AGM is a simple approximation of PPM, which results in an elementary derivation of the update equations and stepsizes of AGM. This view also leads to a transparent and conceptually simple analysis of AGM's convergence by using the analysis of PPM. The derivations also naturally extend to the strongly convex case. Ultimately, the results presented in this paper are of both didactic and conceptual value; they unify and explain existing variants of AGM while motivating other accelerated methods for practically relevant settings.},

This class of methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be signiﬁcantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

Despite the absence of good properties of the sum, such problems, both in convex and nonconvex cases, can be solved with efficiency typical for the first part of the objective. For convex problems of the above structure, we consider primal and dual variants of the gradient method (with convergence rate \$\$O{\textbackslash}left(\{1 {\textbackslash}over k\}{\textbackslash}right)\$\$), and an accelerated multistep version with convergence rate \$\$O{\textbackslash}left(\{1 {\textbackslash}over k{\textasciicircum}2\}{\textbackslash}right)\$\$, where \$\$k\$\$is the iteration counter. For nonconvex problems with this structure, we prove convergence to a point from which there is no descent direction. In contrast, we show that for general nonsmooth, nonconvex problems, even resolving the question of whether a descent direction exists from a point is NP-hard. For all methods, we suggest some efficient “line search” procedures and show that the additional computational work necessary for estimating the unknown problem class parameters can only multiply the complexity of each iteration by a small constant factor. We present also the results of preliminary computational experiments, which confirm the superiority of the accelerated scheme.},

We conclude the paper by showing promising experimental results obtained by applying our approach to incremental algorithms such as SVRG and SAGA for sparse matrix factorization and for learning neural networks.},

We demonstrate that by properly specifying the stepsize policy, the AG method exhibits the best known rate of convergence for solving general nonconvex smooth optimization problems by using first-order information, similarly to the gradient descent method. We then consider an important class of composite optimization problems and show that the AG method can solve them uniformly, i.e., by using the same aggressive stepsize policy as in the convex case, even if the problem turns out to be nonconvex. We demonstrate that the AG method exhibits an optimal rate of convergence if the composite problem is convex, and improves the best known rate of convergence if the problem is nonconvex. Based on the AG method, we also present new nonconvex stochastic approximation methods and show that they can improve a few existing rates of convergence for nonconvex stochastic optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the convergence of the AG method has been established for solving nonconvex nonlinear programming in the literature.},

The inexact proximal point method achieves global convergence with constructive convergence rates when the Moreau envelope of the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property.

	abstract = {We introduce the notion of inexact first-order oracle and analyze the behavior of several first-order methods of smooth convex optimization used with such an oracle. This notion of inexact oracle naturally appears in the context of smoothing techniques, Moreau–Yosida regularization, Augmented Lagrangians and many other situations. We derive complexity estimates for primal, dual and fast gradient methods, and study in particular their dependence on the accuracy of the oracle and the desired accuracy of the objective function. We observe that the superiority of fast gradient methods over the classical ones is no longer absolute when an inexact oracle is used. We prove that, contrary to simple gradient schemes, fast gradient methods must necessarily suffer from error accumulation. Finally, we show that the notion of inexact oracle allows the application of first-order methods of smooth convex optimization to solve non-smooth or weakly smooth convex problems.},

	abstract = {We analyze the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method for optimizing the sum of a finite number of smooth convex functions. Like stochastic gradient (SG) methods, the SAG method’s iteration cost is independent of the number of terms in the sum. However, by incorporating a memory of previous gradient values the SAG method achieves a faster convergence rate than black-box SG methods. The convergence rate is improved from \$\$O(1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\})\$\$to O(1 / k) in general, and when the sum is strongly-convex the convergence rate is improved from the sub-linear O(1 / k) to a linear convergence rate of the form \$\$O({\textbackslash}rho {\textasciicircum}k)\$\$for \$\${\textbackslash}rho {\textless} 1\$\$. Further, in many cases the convergence rate of the new method is also faster than black-box deterministic gradient methods, in terms of the number of gradient evaluations. This extends our earlier work Le Roux et al. (Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, 2012), which only lead to a faster rate for well-conditioned strongly-convex problems. Numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm often dramatically outperforms existing SG and deterministic gradient methods, and that the performance may be further improved through the use of non-uniform sampling strategies.},

SAGA improves on the theory behind SAG and SVRG, with better theoretical convergence rates, and has support for composite objectives where a proximal operator is used on the regulariser. Unlike SDCA, SAGA supports non-strongly convex problems directly, and is adaptive to any inherent strong convexity of the problem. We give experimental results showing the effectiveness of our method.},

In this work we introduce a new method in this class with a theoretical convergence rate four times faster than existing methods, for sums with sufficiently many terms. This method is also amendable to a sampling without replacement scheme that in practice gives further speed-ups. We give empirical results showing state of the art performance.},

Their only essential input parameter is the required accuracy of the solution. At the same time, for each particular problem class they automatically ensure the best possible rate of convergence. We confirm our theoretical results by encouraging numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the fast rate of convergence, typical for the smooth optimization problems, sometimes can be achieved even on nonsmooth problem instances.},
