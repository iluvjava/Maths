Its charts-last approach will prove more intuitive from an optimizer's viewpoint, and all definitions and theorems are motivated to build time-tested optimization algorithms. Starting from first principles, the text goes on to cover current research on topics including worst-case complexity and geodesic convexity.

	abstract = {Starting from where a first course in convex optimization leaves off, this text presents a unified analysis of first-order optimization methods â€“ including parallel-distributed algorithms â€“ through the abstraction of monotone operators. With the increased computational power and availability of big data over the past decade, applied disciplines have demanded that larger and larger optimization problems be solved. This text covers the first-order convex optimization methods that are uniquely effective at solving these large-scale optimization problems. Readers will have the opportunity to construct and analyze many well-known classical and modern algorithms using monotone operators, and walk away with a solid understanding of the diverse optimization algorithms. Graduate students and researchers in mathematical optimization, operations research, electrical engineering, statistics, and computer science will appreciate this concise introduction to the theory of convex optimization algorithms.},
