A brief overview on some of the limitations on Non-stationary wave analysis using Gabor Transform. 

---
### Gabor Transform

The transform is another alternative for analyzing non-stationary signal. 

See [[Lecture 4 13.4 (Gobar Trans)]] for more information which covers the following: 

1. Definition
2. Gaussian Filter

The transform has the following Draw backs: 
1. When the filter is too narrow, we will lose a lot of localized frequencies information. 
2. When the filter is too wide, we will lose a lot of information about localized frequencies, like, the specific time of where the frequency occurred in the Guassian Filter.
