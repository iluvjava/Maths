A normal matrix doesn't mean that all the columns in the matrix are normalized. 

---
### Intro: 
When a matrix is normal, it satisfies the following conditions: 
Let's say that the matrix $A$ is a normal matrix then: e

> $$A^HA = AA^H$$

### Interesting Fact: 

When the matrix is normal, the singular values of the matrix are the absolute eigen values of the original matrix. 

This is followed from the theorems from SVD, [[SVD Theorems]]
