### State variables: 

The things that we are keeping track of for a given system. It unique determine a state of the given system. 

### Continuous Time Diff Eqns

In the case of the a ODE system, the state variables are just the variable of the ODE system. 

$$
x' = f(x, t)
$$

Where x could be a vector of all the state variable. 


### Population Growth

$$
N' = rN
$$

Where N is the size of the population at a given time. Parameter $r$ determines the rate of change of the population. 

$N(t) = N_0e^{rt}$ and this is the solution.

### Key Takeaway
However, we don't need to solve it to get an idea about how the system evolve. And at large part here is to look at the diff eqn and see how the class of solution is gonna look like without solving the diff eqn.
