### **Exact Numeric and Algorithms**
2. [SVD](Matrix%20Theory/Matrix%20Decomposition/SVD.md): The basics, no algorithms
3. [QR](Matrix%20Theory/Matrix%20Decomposition/QR.md): The basics and Algorithms
4. [LU Decomposition](LU%20Decomposition/LU%20Decomposition.md): The basics and algorithms

### **Eigen Decomposition**
* [Eigen Decompose](Matrix%20Theory/Matrix%20Decomposition/Eigen%20Decompose.md): Basics
* [Inverse Power Iteration](Eigen%20Decomposition/Inverse%20Power%20Iteration.md): Basics of Algorithmic approach of the matters. 
	* [Eigen Decomp, The Pure QR](Eigen%20Decomposition/Eigen%20Decomp,%20The%20Pure%20QR.md)
	* [Eigen Decomp Algo 3, Shifted QR](Eigen%20Decomposition/Eigen%20Decomp%20Algo%203,%20Shifted%20QR.md)
	* [Hessenberg Transform intro, HS Reflector](Hessenberg%20Form/Hessenberg%20Transform%20intro,%20HS%20Reflector.md)
	* [Secular Equation and Cuppen's Method](Eigen%20Decomposition/Secular%20Equation%20and%20Cuppen's%20Method.md)
* And it's due to the research in Eigen Decomposition, we now have efficient algorithms for SVD.

### **Advanced Topics**
* [Schur Decomposition](Schur%20Decomposition/Schur%20Decomposition.md): Basics for the theory of Eigenvalue Decomposition. 
* [Krylov Subspace](../MATH%20700%20Master%20Thesis/Krylov%20Subspace.md): Basics and why it's relevant to iterative methods for matrix inverse. 
* [Hessenberg Transform intro, HS Reflector](Hessenberg%20Form/Hessenberg%20Transform%20intro,%20HS%20Reflector.md): Similar to Schur Decomposition, but it's conceived for numerical algorithms. 
	* [Hessenberg Transform with Arnoldi Iterations](Hessenberg%20Form/Hessenberg%20Transform%20with%20Arnoldi%20Iterations.md)
* [Conjugate Gradient with Krylov Subspace](../MATH%20700%20Master%20Thesis/Conjugate%20Gradient%20with%20Krylov%20Subspace.md): An Krylov Subspace Iterative Approximation method, under energy norm of a Positive Definite Hermitian matrix. It's just called Conjugate Gradient because of the A-Orthogoal vectors that are used for approximation.
