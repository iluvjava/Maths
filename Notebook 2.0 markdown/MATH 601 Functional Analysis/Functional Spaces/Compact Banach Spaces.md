### **Intro**

Finite dimensional normed spaces are related to the compactness of the spaces. 

**Definition: Compact Metric Spaces/Subspace**

> The metric space $(X, d)$ is said to be compact, if, for every sequence in $X$, it has a convergence subsequence. The same compactness can be defined for $M\subseteq X$ a subspace of $X$. $M$ is compact if for all sequences in $M$, it hs a convergence subsequence. 


**Lemma: A compact Subset of Metric Space**
> A compact subset $M$ of the metric space $X$ is closed and bounded. (A condition of equivalency)

**Proof**:
