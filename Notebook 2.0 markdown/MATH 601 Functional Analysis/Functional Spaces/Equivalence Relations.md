### **Intro**

It's a relation that generalizes the idea of equality. For a set $A$, where the equivalence relation is generated on, it has the properties that: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & (a, a) \in R
    \\
    & (a, b) \in R \wedge (b, a) \in R
    \\
    & (a, b) \in R \wedge (b, c) \in R \implies
    (a, c) \in R
\end{aligned}
$$
