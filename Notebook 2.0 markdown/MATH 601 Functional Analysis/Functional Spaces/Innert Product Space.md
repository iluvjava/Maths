### **Intro**

An Inner product space is a vector space the is together with an inner product defined with it. However, if the vector space is a complete metric space, then this makes no difference with [Hilbert Space](Hilbert%20Space.md). 

**Inner Product might Differ**: 

> However, there are also subtleties that come with the idea of inner product. See [Inner Product Axiomatically Defined](Inner%20Product%20Axiomatically%20Defined.md) for a detailed covered. Depending on the scalar field of the vector field, the choice of inner product might differ.
