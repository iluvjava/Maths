### **Intro**

There are two type of derivatives in general. The [*F derivative*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_derivative) where it attempts to describe the function locally using a linear mapping, and the [*G derivative*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateaux_derivative) where we want to see the derivative along a single line. These two characterizations is generalizable and describes very different properties of the functions and underlying topological spaces.
