## Std Form (Canonical Form) 
$$A\in R^{m\times n}$$

$$\max(c^T x: Ax \leq b;\; x\in \mathbb{R^n_+})$$

## Fundamental Theorem of Linear Programming 
* No optimal  --> infeasible or unbounded
* Feasible exists --> There is a basis of vector that achieve feasibility
* There is optimal --> At least one optimal exists

## Optimal Basis
* Chose of a set of columns in $A$ such that, it fixes a solution for corresponding $x$ vector for the system $Ax = b$, among all such a collection of columns, find the basis such that, after solving $x$ on the partial matrix, we obtain maximal value for $c^Tx$
* The rank of the optimal basis is $m$.
