### **Intro**

2D and 2D higher order method are way more complicated than the 1D case. We will take a look at it briefly, most of the materials will remain the same as what is discussed during the class. 

Examples of it: 

[9 Points Laplacian and Deferred Corrections](9%20Points%20Laplacian%20and%20Deferred%20Corrections.md), 
[5 Points Laplacian](5%20Points%20Laplacian.md)
