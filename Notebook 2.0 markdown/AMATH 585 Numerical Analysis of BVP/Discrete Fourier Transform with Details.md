### **Intro**

We look into some details of Discrete Fourier Transform. Prereq is a backgroud. Wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform)Under the contex of Numerical Analysis, we have the need to discretized Fourier Transform in hope of making use of them on a digital computer, and the computational advantages of the [FFT Algorithm](../AMATH%20581%20Scientific%20Computing/FFT%20Algorithm.md).
