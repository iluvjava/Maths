### **intro**

 Similar topics in Convexity appeared in amath 515: [Introduction to Convexity](../AMATH%20515%20Optimization%20Fundamentals/Basic%20Convexity/Introduction%20to%20Convexity.md), [Gradient, Hessian Characterization of Convexity](../AMATH%20516%20Numerical%20Optimizations/CVX%20Analysis/Gradient,%20Hessian%20Characterization%20of%20Convexity.md)
 And gradient descend is also covered in amath 515.  We are going to skip it for this class.
