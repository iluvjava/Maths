Here, we will be preparing for duality

### **Hyper Plane**

A half space in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the hyper plane define in that space. 

$$
H_v := \{y: \forall x \quad y\le \langle v, x\rangle - b \}
$$

### **Hyperplane Supports a Convex Set**

A closed convex set is the union of all the half spaces that contains it. 

Let $H_i$ be halfspace such that $C\subset H_i \;\; \forall i$  with $C$ being closed and convex then: 

> $$
> C = \bigcap_{i} H_i
> $$

### **Insights**

Here, we are interested in applying this idea to the epigraph of convex function.
