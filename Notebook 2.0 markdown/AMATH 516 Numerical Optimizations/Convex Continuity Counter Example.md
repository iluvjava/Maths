### **Intro**

In Rockafellar, Theorem 10.4 of his convex analysis textbook, a type of support function that is convex but discontinuous on curves in 2D is presented. All convex function is continuous on its relative interior while going over any line segment, but it's not the case in general. The reference that we are talking about is [Convex Analysis - Rockafellar, R. Tyrrell](References/Convex%20Analysis%20-%20Rockafellar,%20R.%20Tyrrell.pdf).
