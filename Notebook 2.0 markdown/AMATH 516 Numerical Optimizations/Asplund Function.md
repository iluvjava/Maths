### **Intro**

The Asplund function is an example of a difference between 2 convex functions resulting in a function that is still convex. 

**Definition: Asplund Function**
> Define $S\subset X$ to be non-empty. Asplund function is defined as: 
> $$
> \begin{aligned}
>     f(x) := \frac{1}{2}\Vert x\Vert^2 - \frac{1}{2}d^2_S(x), 
> \end{aligned}
> $$

**Observations**: 
$S \subseteq X$ is never stated to be a convex subset.
