### **Definition**

Denote $\mathbb E$ to be the original space, then the dual space of it is $\mathbb E^\star$, which is exactly the same as the original space $\mathbb E$, but it's using the dual norm: $\Vert\cdot \Vert_\star$. (Definition taken from \<Fist Order method in optimizations\>).

### **Dual Basis**

One good example of Dual basis is to consider the matrix $V$, be a matrix whose columns is a basis for the Euclidean space, then there exists $F^TV = I$, then $F$ will be the dual basis for $V$, which is just directly: $F = (V^{-1})^T$.
