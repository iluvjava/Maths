### **Definition**

A cone can be generated from a set in this way: 

> $$
> \mathbb{R}_+(A) := \left\lbrace
>     \alpha x: x \in A, \lambda >  0 
> \right\rbrace
> $$


Please take not that, the non-negative linear span of a set is like in the middle of a convex linear combinations and a linear combinations for a set of vectors. Sometimes we also use the notations $\text{cone}(A)$ to represents the generating cone of a set.
