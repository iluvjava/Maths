### **Intro**

It's a method that solves extremely large scale LP problems that has certain structures to it. We consider some of these sources: 

* \<Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions\> By George Dantzig 
* Cornell University on George Dantzig Decomposition: [here](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/miketodd/or630/lec20.pdf). 

It's also related to what is known as: Delayed Column Generations Algorithms.
