### **Intro**

We are not reading everything in details, but we are going to look at the paper [Proximal Methods in stats and ML](obsidian://open?vault=Notebook%202.0&file=MATH%20999%20(Paper%20Reviews%20and%20Frontier%20Mathematics)%2FReferences%20Aug%202022%2FProximal%20Algorithms%20in%20Stats%20and%20ML.pdf), or [Proximal Algorithms in Stats and ML](Proximal%20Algorithms%20in%20Stats%20and%20ML.pdf).
