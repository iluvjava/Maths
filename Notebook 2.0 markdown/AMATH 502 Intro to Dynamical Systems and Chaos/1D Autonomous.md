### 1D Autonomous

The next part of the lectures focuses on generalized, 1D homogeneous system. 

The behavior of the 1D system determined by the following things about the function on the RHS: 
* $f(x) > 0$
* $f(x) < 0$
* $f(x) = 0$

And each of them will hold information about how the system is gonna evolve. 

For now, assume that the function $f(x)$ is continuous, meaning that, if it were goes from $> 0$ to $<0$, then it has to pass a fixed point (The equilibrium point)

#### Theorem

Given any system $x' = f(x)$, assuming that the function $f(x)$ is continuous, then the solutions to the system will have to be monotonic.
