After the midterm, we will start to solve PDEs in multiple dimension. 

### **Week 6**

* Regular Cartesian Basis: 
	* [Schordinger Eqn in Box](Schordinger%20Eqn%20in%20Box.md)
	* [Helmholtz Equation In Rectangle](Helmholtz%20Equation%20In%20Rectangle.md)
* Other kind of Basis: 
	* [Helmholtz Equation in a Cylinder](Helmholtz%20Equation%20in%20a%20Cylinder.md)
	* [Helmholtz Equation in a Sphere](Helmholtz%20Equation%20in%20a%20Sphere.md)

And to do things in the other coordinate systems, we need tools like: 
* [Bessel's Equation](Bessel's%20Equation.md)
* [Frobenius Method](Frobenius%20Method.md)

* Helmholtz equations in different coordinates are discussed in chapter 11 of the textbook. 

### **Week 7**

* Helmholtz Equation in the sphere: [Helmholtz Equation in a Sphere](Helmholtz%20Equation%20in%20a%20Sphere.md), and the basis function along the $\Theta$ direction give birth to the Associated Legendre Equation, and with a substitution, we get the [Legendre Equation](Legendre%20Equation.md). 


### **Week 8**

* [Sturm Liouville Theory](Sturm%20Liouville%20Theory.md), The theorem that makes all the Eigen Functions for PDEs we learned before. 
* [Eigenfunction Expansion](Eigenfunction%20Expansion.md) method is introduced for Bounded None Homogeneous PDEs/ODEs

### **Week 9, 10**

* [Greens Function](Greens%20Function.md)
* [Greens Function for Heat Eqn](Greens%20Function%20for%20Heat%20Eqn.md)
* [Greens Function 3, 3D Wave](Greens%20Function%203,%203D%20Wave.md)
* [Greens Function 4, Nonhonogeneous Wave](Greens%20Function%204,%20Nonhonogeneous%20Wave.md)
