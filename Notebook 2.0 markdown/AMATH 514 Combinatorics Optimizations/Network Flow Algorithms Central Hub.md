### **Intro**

**Shortest Path types of Algorithm**: 

- (Dijkstra Algorithm)[Dijkstra Algorithm](Everything%20Network%20Flow/Dijkstra%20Algorithm.md) 
	- No negative cycles.
	- No negative arcs.
	- Single source. 
- (Moore Bellman Ford Algorithm)[Shortest Path Label Correcting Algorithm](Everything%20Network%20Flow/Shortest%20Path%20Label%20Correcting%20Algorithm.md) 
	- Negative Cycle Detections.
	- Single Source.
- (Floyd Warshall Shortest Path)[All Pairs Shortest Paths](Everything%20Network%20Flow/All%20Pairs%20Shortest%20Paths.md) 
	- Negative cycles detections. 
	- Construct all pairs shortest distances and predecessor tree all at once.
