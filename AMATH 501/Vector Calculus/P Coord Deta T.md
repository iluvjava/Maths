Given a parametric function that desribes the motion of a particle under the polar coordinates, we are insterested in taking the derivative of it and describe the velocity under the polar coordinates too.

Notation wise, we are getting rid of the vector hat. This is the thing we trying to take the derivative on: 

$$r(t) = ||r(t)||e_r(\theta(t))$$

Taking the derivative on it is just using the product rule on each of the components: 

$$r\;'(t) = ||r(t)||\;'e_r(\theta(t)) + ||r(t)||e_\theta (\theta(t))\theta\;'(t)$$

And, often time we dont' need to re-express for the term $||r(t)||$, sometimes it will loop back.
