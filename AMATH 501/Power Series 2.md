### Laurent Series

If there is a singularity inside the region $|z - z_0|$, where $z_0$ is the point we are centering at for the Taylor Series, then we cannot do it because the Cauchy Integral Theorem failed when there are Singularities inside of the contour. 

And that is the reason that we are introducing the Laurent Series, where even if there is some singularities in inside of the disk $|z - z_0|$, we can still find a way to represent the function as a infinite power series.
