We prove that the \$1/k{\textasciicircum}2\$ convergence rate for the function values can be achieved if the admissible errors are of a certain type and satisfy a sufficiently fast decay condition. Our analysis is based on the machinery of estimate sequences first introduced by Nesterov for the study of accelerated gradient descent algorithms. Furthermore, we give a global complexity analysis, taking into account the cost of computing admissible approximations of the proximal point. An experimental analysis is also presented.

The approach, called Catalyst, builds upon the inexact accelerated proximal point algorithm for minimizing a convex objective function, and consists of approximately solving a sequence of well-chosen auxiliary problems, leading to faster convergence. One of the keys to achieve acceleration in theory and in practice is to solve these sub-problems with appropriate accuracy by using the right stopping criterion and the right warm-start strategy. We give practical guidelines to use Catalyst and present a comprehensive analysis of its global complexity. We show that Catalyst applies to a large class of algorithms, including gradient descent, block coordinate descent, incremental algorithms such as SAG, SAGA, SDCA, SVRG, MISO/Finito, and their proximal variants. For all of these methods, we establish faster rates using the Catalyst acceleration, for strongly convex and non-strongly convex objectives.

Even though these methods may originally require convexity to operate, the proposed approach allows one to use them without assuming any knowledge about the convexity of the objective. In general, the scheme is guaranteed to produce a stationary point with a worst-case efficiency typical of first-order methods, and when the objective turns out to be convex, it automatically accelerates in the sense of Nesterov and achieves near-optimal convergence rate in function values. We conclude the paper by showing promising experimental results obtained by applying our approach to incremental algorithms such as SVRG and SAGA for sparse matrix factorization and for learning neural networks.},

We develop an accelerated randomized proximal coordinate gradient (APCG) method for minimizing such convex composite functions. For strongly convex functions, our method achieves faster linear convergence rates than existing randomized proximal coordinate gradient methods. Without strong convexity, our method enjoys accelerated sublinear convergence rates. We show how to apply the APCG method to solve the regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem and devise efficient implementations that avoid full-dimensional vector operations.

We demonstrate that by properly specifying the stepsize policy, the AG method exhibits the best known rate of convergence for solving general nonconvex smooth optimization problems by using first-order information, similarly to the gradient descent method. We then consider an important class of composite optimization problems and show that the AG method can solve them uniformly, i.e., by using the same aggressive stepsize policy as in the convex case, even if the problem turns out to be nonconvex. We demonstrate that the AG method exhibits an optimal rate of convergence if the composite problem is convex, and improves the best known rate of convergence if the problem is nonconvex. Based on the AG method, we also present new nonconvex stochastic approximation methods and show that they can improve a few existing rates of convergence for nonconvex stochastic optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the convergence of the AG method has been established for solving nonconvex nonlinear programming in the literature.},
